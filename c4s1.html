      <h1 class="subheading">Reasons for Breakdown of USA-USSR Relations</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="textarea"><div class="text" style="text-align:left;">
<ul>
<li>Fought between USA and USSR for 40 years
<li>Divided Europe into two blocs (countries grouped by an alliance or ideology) at end of 1949
    <ul>
      <li>First bloc included those who were under Soviet control</li>
    <li>Second bloc included those that benefited from relations with the US (mostly members of NATO)</li>
    <li>Germany was initially split into four, but eventually became 3 western zones (officially known as West Germany altogether) and 1 eastern one (officially known as East Germany)</li>
</ul>
<li>The US blamed USSR for spreading communism</li>
<li>The USSR defended itself by claiming that it was a protective measure and blamed the US for building a central economic empire with itself at its center. The USSR viewed this as a threat and used this fact to justify its extreme methods of protection</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The relations between USA and USSR became more hostile because of a number of reasons</strong>
<br></br>
<ul>
  <li>Conflict Ideologies</li>
  <ul>
    <li>US was a capitalist democracy, allowing freedom in culture and the market with rights being a key attribute of life in the US</li>
<li>USSR was a communist state, with little freedom of belief and no political opposition granted and a state-controlled economy</li>
<li>There were also previous instances which increased tensions</li>
<ul>
    <li>US and British intervention against the Communists in the Russian Civil War</li>
    <li>USSR’s Nazi-Soviet Pact</li>
  </ul>
<li>Western powers were wary of USSR</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Feared that Communists shared similar intentions with the previous Tsarist government to gain territory in Central Europe and the East Mediterranean</li>
    <li>High-ranking Communists had mentioned revolution and the spread of communism outside of the USSR on a worldwide scale</li>
</ul>
<li>This caused a unstable relationship in WW2
  </ul>
  <li>Wartime Alliance and Relationships</li>
  <ul>
    <li>After Germany invaded USSR in 1941, the image of the alliance of the US, Britain and USSR seemed very cooperative and it seemed like they were on good terms</li>
<li>This was shown by</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The inconvenient journey of British ships across the Baltic to provide resources to the USSR</li>
    <li>The Lend Lease Programme (the selling, lending, and renting of weaponry) granted by US to USSR</li>
</ul>
<li>However, in reality, the relations between these three countries was tense</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Stalin kept secrets and did not share information about his plans in the war</li>
    <li>Churchill refused to share knowledge of Enigma codes (coded messages used for the communication of German forces) after the British broke the code</li>
    <li>British and American pilots protested about how Russians seemed to have a lack of trust for them</li>
    <li>Foreign sailors carrying supplies were often given a small budget. The fact that they had to move across Russian ports under strict control made this worse</li>
    <li>A lot of unreliability and questioning of methods within this relationship</li>
</ul>
