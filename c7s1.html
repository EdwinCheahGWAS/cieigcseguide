<strong>Background Information</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The states around the Persian Gulf (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE, and Oman) possessed one half of the known oil reserves in the world in the last third of the 20th century</li>
  <li>Countries were dependent on the oil resources in the Gulf and had great influence in the economy of industrial nations, which needed oil for transport, industry, and more</li>
  <li>Therefore, developed countries did their best to maintain positive relations with the Middle East</li>
  <li>Because of these relations, the the countries that traded with the Middle East (such as America, Western Europe, Japan, South Africa and more) were able to maintain good standards of living for the people</li>
  <li>The events of the Gulf were very important as countries all across the world depended on trade for oil resources. If the resources were not stably priced or were insufficient, this would impact the countries that relied on the Gulf</li>
  <li>The Gulf suffered from instability, conflict, and constant changes which affected the oil market, and led to economic and political instability in the buying countries</li>
  <li>Saddam Hussein's rise to power in Iraq played a role in this</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Saddam Hussein's childhood and early years</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Born in village Al-Ouja (13km north of Tikrit, on western banks of the Tigris River) on 28 April 1937</li>
  <li>His father was very poor and did not own land. He most likely died before Saddam's birth</li>
  <li>Sabha, his mother worked as a fortune teller. She remarried to a caretaker in a school in Tikrit named Hassan al-Ibrahim. He was a violent father who bullied Saddam and stopped him from going to school and set him to commit crimes</li>
  <li>Because of this, Saddam only learnt to write and read at the age of 10 and was treated like an outcast. He often carried an iron bar to defend himself</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The method Iraq was governed during the 20th century</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Before WW1, Iraq was part of the Ottoman Empire</li>
  <li>Hungary's Parliament created a new set of laws, introducing rights to run trade unions, personal freedoms, a press with more freedom, more voting rights, and recognised the uprising in 1956 as a movement and not an insurgency</li>
  <li>After WW1 from 1919-32, it was administered by Britain as a League of Nations mandate (meaning Britain was approved by the LoN to rule Iraq)</li>
  <li>In 1921, Britain placed Iraq under the rule of the Hashemite Monarchy</li>
  <li>In 1932, Iraq gained its independence from Britain</li>
  <li>In July 1958, The Hashmite Monarchy was overthrown by General Abdul Karim Qaseem</li>
  <li>In February 1963, Qaseem was deposed by military officers and the Baath Party</li>
  <li>In November 1963, The Baath Party was forced out of power by President Abdul Salam Arif after conflicts within the factions of the party</li>
  <li>In July 1968, The Baath Party and other members of the previous government overthrew the previous government under President Arif. Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr became president</li>
  <li>In July 1979, Saddam Hussein became president</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The influence of Khairallah Tulfar</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Khairallah Tulfar was Saddam's uncle (his mother's brother), and acted as Saddam's foster father who was originally an army officer</li>
  <li>He was put in jail in 1941 for being part of an attempt to push the British out of Iraq</li>
  <li>When he was released in 1947, Saddam lived at his place</li>
  <li>Khairallah created strong mindsets of that despised Western involvement and wished for the unification of Arabs under one nation in Saddam and also of hatred for the Hashemite monarchy which ruled Iraq under Britain</li>
  <li>He also made Saddam go to a local school to learn primary level education</li>
  <li>In 1955 (when Saddam was 18), Saddam and Khairallah moved to Baghdad, enrolling for Karkh High School in an attempt to be accepted into Baghdad Military Academy. Saddam was devastated when he was not accepted in 1957</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Early Political Activity</strong>
<ul>
  <li>In 1957, Saddam joined the Baath Party, inspired by Khairallah</li>
  <li>He became part of activities against the government, including violence against political opponents</li>
  <li>In October 1958, Saddam assassinated a local government official to prove his loyalty to Khairallah</li>
  <li>Saddam gained a reputation for doing his job mercilessly</li>
  <li>He was selected by the Baath Party to assassinate Iraq's ruler at the time, General Abdul Karim Qaseem</li>
  <li>In October 1958, the attempt took place and failed. Saddam was injured and made him known as one of Iraq's most wanted men</li>
  <li>Saddam was exiled, and spent three months in Damascus (capital of Syria), and then three years in Cairo (capital of Egypt)</li>
  <li>He spent most of this time to educate himself better</li>
  <li>In 1961, he graduated high school at age 24 and later studied law at a university at the city</li>
  <li>However, he stopped studying law after General Abdul Karim Qaseem was overthrown and died in February 1963</li>
  <li>In the government of the Baath Party, Saddam was given a small position of trying to improve the lives of peasants in the Central Farmer's Office</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Saddam's rise to power in the government</strong>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Saddam made friendships and alliances with other politicians, allowing him to increase the power of his position</li>
  <li>Prime Minister Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr was the cousin of Khairallah</li>
  <li>Saddam immediately joined his faction and tried to prove himself</li>
  <li>The Baath Party was forced out of power by President Abdul Salam Arif after conflicts within the factions of the party</li>
  <li>Saddam gained power in the Baath Party, as the extremists had lost respect, and Hassan al-Bakr's (leader of Hassan's faction) position as leader of the moderates was strengthened, and so did Saddam's influence as one that Bakr trusted</li>
  <li>In 1964, Saddam became a part of the Regional Command, a body for supreme decision-making of the Baath Party for his loyalty</li>
  <li>Saddam acknowledged that power from politics in Iraq came from military strength, and plotted to overthrow President Arif with the plan supposed to happen in September 1964. However, his plot was exposed and he was imprisoned until his escape in July 1966</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The July Revolution 1968</strong>
<ul>
  <li>After Saddam's escape, he focused on...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Reorganising the party</li>
    <li>Completing to establish the security apparatus (the body to maintain security and enforce law)</li>
    <li>Forming new military forces</li>
    <li>Increasing connected branches of the Baath party throughout the country</li>
  </ul>
  <li>However, he knew that these smaller branches could not overthrow President Arif without working together</li>
  <li>The party made connections to high-ranking officers under the government that were understanding of the Baath party's aims</li>
  <li>Saddam argued in the Regional Command that the alliance with these officers would be temporary and that they could be disposed of during or after the revolution</li>
  <li>The coup ended up being non-violent and president Arif fled to London, and Bakr became President</li>
  <li>Saddam made sure that the previous government's colonels would be permanently exiled and became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, the most important decision-making organisation in Iraq</li>
  <li>Saddam became the second-in-command</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Saddam's steps to becoming President</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Saddam became the president only after a whole 11 years of serving under President Bakr</li>
  <li>Saddam was probably the most influential government member from as early as 1972 with him acting as equals with the President despite being a Deputy</li>
  <li>He was careful not to be seen as someone with ambitions to overtake Bakr as the president and made sure to maintain his positive relationship with Bakr</li>
  <li>He was able to become the president because of his cunning towards those who stood in his path</li>
  <li>He could uncover conspiracies and even make them up in order to eliminate his opponents as he had control over the security apparatus.</li>
<li>He also ensured that those who had good relations with himself were appointed to be members of the Revolutionary Command Council</li>
<li>In the early 1970s, Saddam proved himself to be skilled at handling domestic and foreign affairs, leading diplomatic initiatives such as the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the USSR in April 1972 to form an alliance with the superpower</li>
<li>He rooted for nationalising the oil industry and established infrastructure to improve the lives of the people (such as schools, hospitals, and improved transport)</li>
<li>The aging President Bakr began to decline in health, and Saddam basically took over as the leader without the official title as president</li>
<li>Through underhanded tactics (eg. threats, bullying), Bakr resigned and Saddam became the unopposed leader of Iraq at age 42 without using violence</li>
</ul>
