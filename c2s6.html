<ul>
  <strong>There were minor failures that did not threaten international peace as much. As countries were exhausted from the war, there were little failures during the 1920s</strong>
  <br></br>
  <p>Vilna (1920)</p>
<ul>
<li>Vilna had many Polish-speaking people</li>
<li>Poland invaded Vilna</li>
<li>Lithuania appealed to League of Nations</li>
<li>Poland refused a proposed plebiscite by the League</li>
<li>Matters passed onto the Conference of Ambassadors which awarded Vilna to Poland</li>
<li>Note: Conference of Ambassadors: higher-ranking diplomat providing judgement on issues from the Treaty</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Occupation of the Ruhr</p>
<ul>
  <li>Germany announced it could not make reparation payment in 1922</li>
<li>France believed that Germany simply just did not want to abide the Treaty. Therefore, in January 1923, the French occupied the Ruhr along with Belgian troops and seized coal and resources equal in value to the intended payments</li>
<li>Germany could not give armed resistance, and instead got passive resistance from residents of the Ruhr through strikes</li>
<li>Residents were expelled and casualties were inflicted by the French</li>
<li>Spendings heightened as the displaced population needed to be relocated and fed</li>
<li>Because of the lost revenue, the government printed money, leading to inflation. As money rapipdly lost value, the middle class with savings were affected the most and bartering became a way of payment</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Corfu Incident</p>
<ul>
  <li>Italian invasion of Corfu</li>
<li>Italian general killed on patrol on Greek territory bordering Albania</li>
<li>Mussolini demanded 50 million lira compensation and execution of those who killed the general</li>
<li>Greece appealed to League, which initially condemned Italy</li>
<li>Mussolini wanted to pass judgement to Conference of Ambassadors</li>
<li>Conference of Ambassadors supported Mussolini, Greece had to pay and Italy to withdraw troops from Corfu</li>
<li>Displayed League ineffectiveness against powerful nations</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>International Labour Organisation (SUCCESS)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Albert Thomas was director</li>
<li>Made working conditions better</li>
<li>Used reports and information about different work policies and persuaded governments to follow them (eg. health and safety of white lead in print manufacturing)</li>
<li>Some countries had not been ready for these changes (eg. Britain did not have a leaving-school age of 15+ until WW2, while the minimum age of employment was 15 before)</li>
<li>In US, employers did not allow employees to form trade unions despite changes made with the advice of the ILO</li>
<li>Contributed a lot to changing working hours, sickness and unemployment insurance, minimum wages, pensions (money drawn to help with retirement)</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Slavery Commission (PARTIAL SUCCESS)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aimed to eradicate the practice of slavery and unmoral practices of exploitation</li>
<li>Reports and persuasion was used to convince governments to take effective action</li>
<li>There were some successes that contributed to the lessening of the use of slave practices such as the release of 200,000 slaves in Sierra Leone and cutting the death rate on the Tanganyikan Railway from 50% to 4%</li>
<li>However, these contributions were nowhere near their ultimate goal of abolishing slavery</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Disarmament Commission (Failure)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aimed to disarm nations "to the lowest point consistent with national safety"</li>
<li>Even at the end of 1920s, only losing countries disarmed according to the Treaty of Versailles</li>
<li>Washington Naval Conference was small success, limiting navy force of US, Britain, France, and Japan</li>
<li>Showed difficulty for willingness to disarm</li>
<li>A World Disarmament Conference was unable to be organised before 1932 because of disagreement on definitions, classifications, methods of armaments and other technicalities</li>
<li>In Disarmament Conference in 1932-1934, France was willing to disarm only if guarantees were given by Britain or the US, which they were not able to provide. Germany accused the Allies of not being serious about disarmament</li>
