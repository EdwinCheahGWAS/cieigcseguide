      <strong style="font-size: 2vw;">B8.1: Gas exchange</strong>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Organs of gas exchange</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Lungs: Bring oxygen into our bodies and force carbon dioxide out</li>
        <li>Diaphragm: Contracts to become flat, and increasing the area of the chest cavity to pull air into the lungs. It then returns to its original shape to force air out of the lungs</li>
        <li>Ribs: Arrangement of bones protecting internal organs like the lungs</li>
        <li>Intercostal muscles: Muscles located within the ribcage. The external intercostal muscles contract to decrease air pressure and suck air inside the lungs</li>
        <li>Larynx: An organ connected to the top of the trachea. Air passes through the larynx to the lungs. It can also make sounds through vibrations</li>
        <li>Trachea: A windpipe connect the nose and the mouth to the lungs</li>
        <li>Bronchi (singular: bronchus): Large branches of the trachea. There is one bronchus connected to the left lung and one connected to the right</li>
        <li>Bronchioles: Smaller branches off the bronchi that connect to the alveoli</li>
        <li>Alveoli: Air sacs where gas exchange takes place</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p>The surfaces for gas exchange are specialised to performs its functions, and allow quicker diffusion of gases. They all have...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Large surface area (to increase the area where diffusion happens)</li>
        <li>Thin walls (for particles to travel less distances when diffusing)</li>
        <li>Good movement of air to keep a high concentration gradient for faster diffusion</li>
        <li>Good blood supply to keep a high concentration gradient for faster diffusion</li>
          </ul>
        <br></br>
        <strong>Differences between inhaled and exhaled air</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The air we inhale is around 20-21% oxygen, and the air we exhale is around 16%. This is because the blood returning to the lungs will have a lower concentration of oxygen than the air in the alveoli (as oxygen diffused into cells for respiration), meaning that oxygen will diffuse to the blood in the lungs</li>
          <li>The air we inhale is around 0.04% CO2, and the air we exhale is around 4%. This is because the blood blood returning the the lungs will have a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than the air in the alveoli (as carbon dioxide is produced from respiration in the body's cells), meaning that carbon dioxide will diffuse into the alveoli</li>
          <li>The air we inhale has lower water vapour than the air we exhale. This is because the moist lining of the alveoli causes water to evaporate into vapour from the warmth of the body, causing the air we exhale to have more water vapour</li>
        </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Using limewater to test for CO₂</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Air is inhaled from the tube on the left</li>
        <li>Limewater is normally clear, but becomes cloudy when carbon dioxide is added</li>
        <li>As the air exhaled will bubble carbon dioxide, the tube on the right will become clouded, while the tube on the left will remain clear</li>
        <li>This shows that there is more carbon dioxide in the air exhaled than the air inhaled</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Effects of physical activity on the rate and depth of breathing</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical activity increases the depth and rate of breathing</li>
        <li>The amount of breaths and chest expansion will increase after exercises</li>
        <li>This happens because muscles need more oxygen to aerobically respire to provide the amount of energy needed</li>
        <li>When there is not enough oxygen to reach the energy demand, cells respire anaerobically without oxygen, and produces lactic acid</li>
        <li>Lactic acid denatures enzymes with its low pH and needs to be removed by combining with oxygen. Therefore after exercise, oxygen needs to be distributed to the rest of the body to remove lactic acid</li>
        <li>When respiration increases, more carbon dioxide is released</li>
        <li>Carbon dioxide is acidic, and could affect the activity of enzymes. Therefore, it needs to be removed</li>
        <li>Receptor cells transmit messages to the muscles and the lungs to contract faster and stronger to lower the carbon dioxide concentration</li>
        <li>Therefore, the depth and rate of breathing increases</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Goblet cells, mucus, and ciliated cells</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The passage to the lungs are lined with ciliated cells, which have hair like projectiles with sweep mucus towards the nose and the throat</li>
        <li>The mucus traps harmful particles, bacteria, and dust to make sure these particles do not get to and damage the lungs</li>
        <li>The mucus is made by goblet cells</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Smoking</strong>
      <p>Smoking has several harms on the breathing system and can cause several diseases. Some of these are...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Smoking damages the alveoli, causing gas exchange to be slower</li>
          <li>Therefore, those who suffer from the disease have less oxygen in their blood. In consequence, they are often tired, have more trouble breathing, and more</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Lung cancer</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Tobacco contains many substances that can cause cancer (eg. tar)</li>
          <li>Therefore, it poses threat of lung cancer (as well as cancer of the mouth, oesophagus, and throat)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells carrying oxygen</li>
          <li>The ability to carry oxygen of the haemoglobin is reduced, and less oxygen could be transported, causing coronary heart disease</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Toxic substances in the gas exchange system</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Carbon monoxide: Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces its ability to carry oxygen</li>
          <li>Nicotine: Narrows blood vessels which causes higher blood pressure and more difficulty in transporting blood</li>
          <li>Tar: Tar is a carcinogen, and could cause cancers in the lung, mouth, oesophagus, and throat</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
<strong style="font-size: 2vw;">B8.2: Respiration</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Respiration is used to breakdown nutrient molecules to release the energy stored in the bonds of the molecules</li>
  <li>This energy is used for different functions in the body such as...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Muscle contraction</li>
    <li>Protein synthesis</li>
    <li>Growth</li>
    <li>Cell division</li>
    <li>Maintenance of a body temperature</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>There are two types of respiration: aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration</p>
<br></br>
<strong>Aerobic Respiration</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The chemical reactions in cells that use oxygen to break down nutrient molecules for energy</li>
  <li>It completely breaks down glucose and releases quite a good amount of energy</li>
  <li>The balanced equation for aerobic respiration is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
  <li>The word equation for aerobic respiration is Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Anaerobic Respiration</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The chemical reactions in cells that do not use oxygen to break down nutrient molecules for energy</li>
  <li>It partially breaks down glucose and does not release as much energy as aerobic respiration</li>
  <li>It produces different products in different usages</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Anaerobic respiration in muscles</strong>
<ul>
  <li>In muscles, anaerobic respiration is used when there is vigorous physical activity. As only a limited amount of oxygen can be delivered, anaerobic respiration is used to release the remainder of energy needed</li>
  <li>When anaerobic respiration occurs in the muscles, glucose is broken down and produces lactic acid</li>
  <li>There will be more lactic acid in muscle cells, which lowers the pH</li>
  <li>A lower pH could threaten to denature the enzymes in the cells, and therefore lactic acid needs to be removed</li>
  <li>The cells expel lactic acid into the blood where it carries the lactic acid to the liver to be oxidised, and turns into carbon dioxide and water</li>
  <li>This is why we breathe heavily and have a high pulse rate after exercising (as we need to transport lactic acids from the muscles to the liver and continue delivering oxygen to oxidise lactic acid)</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Anaerobic respiration in yeast</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The process of anaerobic respiration in yeast is used in bread making</li>
  <li>The balanced equation for anaerobic respiration in yeast is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> → 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + 2CO<sub>2</sub></li>
  <li>When the glucose in the sugar is added in the dough to make the bread, the glucose goes through anaerobic respiration</li>
  <li>The carbon dioxide produced makes the bread rise, while the alcohol evaporates when the bread is baked</li>
</ul>
