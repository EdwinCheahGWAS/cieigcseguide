    </div>
    <div class="textarea"><div class="text" style="text-align:left;">
<ul>
  <li>In 1968, the Prague Spring began, a period of the government making reform to improve the conditions of the people and lessen Soviet control over Czechoslovakia</li>
  <li>The result was Russian invasion, the replacement of the leader, and an end to these reforms</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Cause for the demand of reform</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The economy struggled in the 1960s</li>
  <li>Production was struggling, and goods were therefore not selling much</li>
  <li>Therefore, the quality of living was bad as well</li>
  <li>Because of this, changes were made</li>
  <li>One of the most important one was the loosening of state control on businesses and increased company control over wages and prices (which was against communist principles)</li>
  <li>Antonin Novotny was replaced as the leader of the communist party after student protests by Alexander Dubcek who promised reform. This included...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Freedom of the press (no more censorship). This led to emerging reports of corruption in higher classes</li>
    <li>Freedom of speech, people were now allowed to criticise the government</li>
    <li>Members of the communist party could not present their honest opinions about methods to rule the country</li>
    <li>There was an increase in "workers' councils" that represented their workforce to discuss with employers</li>
    <li>Those who self-identified themselves as Slovak or followed Slovak customs weree recognised</li>
    <li>Freedom of movement for all</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Dubcek knew that Moscow may have viewed this change as dangerous and tried to reassure the Soviets by declaring that there was no intention to change foreign poplicy (eg. withdraw from the the Warsaw Pact)</li>
  <li>This declaration was an attempt to prevent Soviet military entering the country</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Soviet response</strong>
<ul>
  <li>In July 1968, the USSR announced that evidence was found of a planned West German invasion</li>
<li>The USSR asked permission to protect Czechoslovakia with the Red Army and Dubcek refused</li>
<li>A month later, the army of countries in the Warsaw Pact launched an invasion on Czechoslovakia led by the USSR without the knowledge of Dubcek</li>
<li>Dubcek ordered for there to be no resistance as he knew it would be pointless</li>
<li>The Prague Spring was crushed, and it was later announced that the reforms would no longer continue</li>
<li>Leonid Brezhnev, the leader of the USSR, and leaders of Eastern European countries were afraid that people would demand freedoms like in Czechoslovakia</li>
<li>Albania had resigned from the Warsaw Pact thinking the USSR had become too liberal after Stalin's death</li>
<li>The Brezhnev Doctrine was introduced to prevent similar incidents, declaring that communist countries should be aware in order not to impact other communsit states</li>
<li>Communist countries were governed by two principles to...</li>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a one-party system</li>
  <li>Stay a part of the Warsaw Pact</li>
</ul>
<li>USSR used military force to enforce these terms</li>
<li>In April 1969, Dubcek was expelled from the party and replaced as party secretary</li>
<li>A 20 year period of "normalisation" followed the invasion</li>
<li>The rule in Czechoslovakia was closely controlled and monitored by the USSR through army officers, the KGB (secret police), and Czechoslovaks loyal to the USSR</li>
  </ul>
  <br></br>
  <p>However, in 1956, the people saw a hope for change. This was because...</p>
<ul>
  <li>They thought Eisenhower (the US president) or the United Nations would help them after their speeches</li>
  <li>Stalin died in 1953, and the new leader Khruschev had not allowed the arrest of 400 political opponents in Hungary</li>
  <li>Workers in Poland had protested to the Soviets, and compromises were made. This made people in Hungary hope that this would be the same for them</li>
  </ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The Events of the Uprising (1956)</strong>
<p>October 23:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students in Budapest demand true socialism and a removal of Soviet occupation from Hungary</li>
  <li>Some were arrested, when other protestors tried to save them, the police fired on the crowd</li>
  <li>A statue of Stalin was toppled as a gesture of protest</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 24:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Russian troops had been sent in to control the riots with tanks around the Parliament building</li>
  <li>Soviet soldiers guarding key bridges and roads</li>
  <li>Hungarian soldiers and workers still joined in the student protests</li>
  <li>Imre Nagy became the new Hungarian Prime Minister appointed by the Hungarian Communist Party</li>
  <li>He asked Khruschev to remove his troops and promised free and fair elections to the people</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 25:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many protestors gather outside the Parliament building</li>
  <li>The protestors took over the country</li>
  <li>Soviet politicians were forced to flee</li>
  <li>Imre Nagy remained as Prime Minister and promised change</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 28:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khruschev did not want conflict</li>
  <li>He accepted Imre Nagy's requests and the Russian military backed out from Hungary</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 29 to November 3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Democracy and freedom of speech and religion was introduced</li>
  <li>Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty (a previously arrested leading Catholic) and other political prisoners were released</li>
  <li>Nagy announced that Hungary would withdraw from the Warsaw Pact</li>
  <li>Nagy appealed to the United Nations in November 1 to deal with the conflict</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>November 4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1,000 Russian tanks entered Budapest and immediately seized control over Hungarian airfields, bridges, junctions, and highways</li>
  <li>Russian forces overpowered the Hungarian forces and protestors in the fierce fighting</li>
  <li>Janos Kadar became the new prime minister and promised Nagy and his followers a safe escape  from Hungary. However, after 3 weeks, they were kidnapped, tried, and executed for treason</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Support for the War</strong>
<ul>
  <li>North Vietnamese troops launched a surprise attack named the "Tet Offensive" in January 1968, attacking 30 American targets (objects or installations) and dozens of cities in South Vietnam</li>
  <li>No territory was captured, but heavy losses were caused in the American forces</li>
  <li>American media marked this incident as a defeat, which caused a drop in support for...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Johnson handling the job of being a president</li>
    <li>Johnson handling the situation in Vietnam</li>
    <li>The initial involvement of the US in the Vietnam war</li>
    <li>The use of military solutions to the war</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Another event, the My Lai massacre further turned away support, as American soldiers massacred hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the village My Lai</li>
  <li>In 1968, because of the conflict in the Democratic Party over Vietnam and the horrific My Lai incident, Johnson did not run for a second term for president</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The end of the war</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Richard Nixon was elected as the next president, and in 1969, he was planning to start pulling US troops out of the war</li>
  <li>Nixon wanted to peacefully end the war through negotiation</li>
  <li>He worked towards Vietnamisation, a policy to continue supply and eonomically support South Vietnam but only have the South Vietnamese do the fighting</li>
  <li>From December 1970 to September 1972, the number of American troops went from 350,000 to 40,000</li>
  <li>Even though Nixon tried to resolve the conflict peacefully, he didn't do so all the time</li>
  <li>In 1970, after negotiations with North Vietnam failed, Nixon launched bombing on North Vietnamese bases in Cambodia and sent in soldiers after bombings were unsuccessful to forcefully end the war</li>
  <li>This was all done in secret to avoid attention from other countries, but the escalation of war caused protests in the USA</li>
  <li>National Guardsmen had killed 4 students from Kent University in one of the protests</li>
  <li>A peace treaty was signed in Paris in 1973, and prisoners of war were released on the condition that the USA withdrew and dismantled its bases</li>
  <li>There was a brief pause of fighting after America withdrew, but the fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam shortly after</li>
  <li>North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Reasons for USA withdrawal from the war</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Loss of support from the US people</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This was heavily influenced by the media, and when the media turned against the war, so did the people</li>
    <li>Deaths and casualties being shown on TV and people having personally lost loved ones turned people against the war</li>
    <li>Cronkite's news report, a popular media source turned against the violence in the war and promoted peaceful negotiation to end the war</li>
  </ul>
  <li>North Vietnamese had better tactics</li>
  <ul>
    <li>USA generally had a stronger military (they had better weapons, were better trained...)</li>
    <li>However, the surprise attacks from North Vietnam's guerilla warfare removed the USA's military advantage</li>
    <li>US soldiers had trouble finding and even identifying the enemy as enemy soldiers looked like South Vietnamese soldiers</li>
    <li>The traps and unexpected methods would catch US soldiers off guard</li>
  </ul>
  <li>North Vietnam retained the support of the Vietnamese people</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The local people resisted the American troops (eg. spreading the teachings of Ho Chi Minh, leading American troops into ambushes...)</li>
    <li>The Vietnamese people did not betray North Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
