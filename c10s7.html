<ul>
  <li>Bolsheviks were the left wing group in the Social Democratic Party that supported Lenin</li>
  <li>They wanted a worker's revolution and further change beyond the fall of the Tsar</li>
  <li>They were able to exploit the weaknesses of the Provisional Government and replace the Provisional Government as the new leaders</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>They were able to seize power mainly because of the following reason</strong>
<br></br>
<p>Lenin</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leader of the Bolsheviks</li>
  <li>Returned from exile on a train that the Germans provided (as they believed he would cause chaos in Russia which would help them win the war)</li>
  <li>Published April Theses criticising Bolsheviks which did not push for revolution and sided with the Provisional Government</li>
  <li>Urged peasants to seize land from nobility</li>
  <li>Urged workers to take over factories</li>
  <li>Promised peace, land, and bread, which the people turned to after the failings of the Provisional Government</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>July Days</p>
<ul>
  <li>The failed Kerensky Offensive received heavy backlash</li>
  <li>Problems still continued there was little food, which was expensive to buy</li>
  <li>Soldiers and sailors protested in Petrograd in July 1917, later joined by industrial workers</li>
  <li>Riots happened in 16-17 July, and were oppressed by the Provisional Government</li>
  <li>The people turned to the Bolsheviks who promised what they wanted, who were unprepared to lead this early</li>
  <li>The protests fell apart and failed</li>
  <li>Kerensky decided to become more strict, reintroducing the death penalty</li>
  <li>Bolshevik leaders were arrested, and Lenin fled in exile to Finland</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Kornilov Affair and the November Revolution</p>
<ul>
  <li>The unpopularity of the Provisional Government began to grow</li>
  <li>To keep the situation under control in Petrograd, Kerensky appointed a new Supreme Commander, General Kornilov</li>
  <li>Kornilov decided to take over Petrograd, and Kerensky realised what was happening</li>
  <li>Kerensky was not sure if he was supported by the army because of Kornilov's popularity within it, so he turned to other groups, including the Bolsheviks</li>
  <li>The Bolsheviks were able to assemble 25,000 recruits, dig trenches, and fortify the city</li>
  <li>This gave the Bolsheviks a good image as defenders of Petrograd</li>
  <li>However, Kornilov's coup fell apart without any action and violence as his soldiers did not want to fight members of the Petrograd Soviet</li>
  <li>Even though Kerensky survived this incident, the Bolsheviks were able to gain power much more easily due to it</li>
  <li>Kerensky had given the Bolsheviks weapons to defend the city, which made their Red Army more powerful in the revolution</li>
  <li>Kerensky lost support, and Bolsheviks gained support for protecting the city</li>
  <li>The Bolsheviks declared to Kerensky that they were going to seize power on November 7th</li>
  <li>Kerensky fled Russia, and the Bolsheviks took over the Winter Palace and key parts of the city, and later arresting the senior ministers of the Provisional Government</li>
  <li>Lenin's government became the new government</li>
</ul>
