<ul>
  <li>USSR was on the winning side of WW2</li>
  <li>It had three main aims</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating a buffer zone on the west of Russia to protect it from western invasion</li>
    <li>Spread communism</li>
    <li>Use resources taken from other countries to rebuild the USSR after the war</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The USSR gradually established control over Eastern Europe, forming an iron curtain: a line that separated the capitalist western Europe and countries under Soviet control</li>
  <li>The Soviet-controlled countries were under the economic and military alliances from COMECON and the Warsaw Pact</li>
  <li>However, opposition began to increase over Eastern Europe</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Background Information</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Hungary was on the losing side of WW2 (the Axis powers)</li>
  <li>Hungary became part of the Soviet bloc under Soviet control after the war</li>
  <li>The government was under influence of Moscow and set up a communist state</li>
  <li>Hungary was part of the Warsaw Pact signed in 1955, a military alliance with the Soviet bloc</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Cause of the rebellion in 1956</strong>
<p>People were discontent with the communist policies and Soviet influence. Some factors include...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Politics</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The Smallholders Party, working for the rights of Hungarians, won the majority vote in the elections after the war</li>
    <li>The Soviets did not allow them to form a government and instead let the Hungarian Communist Party form one, even though they only won 17% of the vote</li>
    <li>The government ran without the people's agreement</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Repression</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Media was censored</li>
    <li>A secret police (the AVH) oppressed the people</li>
    <li>Russia controlled what schools taught</li>
    <li>2,000 were executed and 100,000 imprisoned in the strict communist rule</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Religion</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Hungarians were religious, but religion was banned as "dangerous propaanda" under commuist rule</li>
    <li>A leading Catholic, Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty was torturred in prison after arrest</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Economy</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Hungary suffered a lot of damage and needed rebuilding and also had a bad economy after the war</li>
    <li>Even so, Hungary's resources and food were being taken by Russia</li>
    <li>Therefore, the quality of life also fell</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <br></br>
  <p>However, in 1956, the people saw a hope for change. This was because...</p>
<ul>
  <li>They thought Eisenhower (the US president) or the United Nations would help them after their speeches</li>
  <li>Stalin died in 1953, and the new leader Khruschev had not allowed the arrest of 400 political opponents in Hungary</li>
  <li>Workers in Poland had protested to the Soviets, and compromises were made. This made people in Hungary hope that this would be the same for them</li>
  </ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The Events of the Uprising (1956)</strong>
<p>October 23:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students in Budapest demand true socialism and a removal of Soviet occupation from Hungary</li>
  <li>Some were arrested, when other protestors tried to save them, the police fired on the crowd</li>
  <li>A statue of Stalin was toppled as a gesture of protest</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 24:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Russian troops had been sent in to control the riots with tanks around the Parliament building</li>
  <li>Soviet soldiers guarding key bridges and roads</li>
  <li>Hungarian soldiers and workers still joined in the student protests</li>
  <li>Imre Nagy became the new Hungarian Prime Minister appointed by the Hungarian Communist Party</li>
  <li>He asked Khruschev to remove his troops and promised free and fair elections to the people</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 25:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many protestors gather outside the Parliament building</li>
  <li>The protestors took over the country</li>
  <li>Soviet politicians were forced to flee</li>
  <li>Imre Nagy remained as Prime Minister and promised change</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 28:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Khruschev did not want conflict</li>
  <li>He accepted Imre Nagy's requests and the Russian military backed out from Hungary</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>October 29 to November 3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Democracy and freedom of speech and religion was introduced</li>
  <li>Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty (a previously arrested leading Catholic) and other political prisoners were released</li>
  <li>Nagy announced that Hungary would withdraw from the Warsaw Pact</li>
  <li>Nagy appealed to the United Nations in November 1 to deal with the conflict</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>November 4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1,000 Russian tanks entered Budapest and immediately seized control over Hungarian airfields, bridges, junctions, and highways</li>
  <li>Russian forces overpowered the Hungarian forces and protestors in the fierce fighting</li>
  <li>Janos Kadar became the new prime minister and promised Nagy and his followers a safe escape  from Hungary. However, after 3 weeks, they were kidnapped, tried, and executed for treason</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Support for the War</strong>
<ul>
  <li>North Vietnamese troops launched a surprise attack named the "Tet Offensive" in January 1968, attacking 30 American targets (objects or installations) and dozens of cities in South Vietnam</li>
  <li>No territory was captured, but heavy losses were caused in the American forces</li>
  <li>American media marked this incident as a defeat, which caused a drop in support for...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Johnson handling the job of being a president</li>
    <li>Johnson handling the situation in Vietnam</li>
    <li>The initial involvement of the US in the Vietnam war</li>
    <li>The use of military solutions to the war</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Another event, the My Lai massacre further turned away support, as American soldiers massacred hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the village My Lai</li>
  <li>In 1968, because of the conflict in the Democratic Party over Vietnam and the horrific My Lai incident, Johnson did not run for a second term for president</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The end of the war</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Richard Nixon was elected as the next president, and in 1969, he was planning to start pulling US troops out of the war</li>
  <li>Nixon wanted to peacefully end the war through negotiation</li>
  <li>He worked towards Vietnamisation, a policy to continue supply and eonomically support South Vietnam but only have the South Vietnamese do the fighting</li>
  <li>From December 1970 to September 1972, the number of American troops went from 350,000 to 40,000</li>
  <li>Even though Nixon tried to resolve the conflict peacefully, he didn't do so all the time</li>
  <li>In 1970, after negotiations with North Vietnam failed, Nixon launched bombing on North Vietnamese bases in Cambodia and sent in soldiers after bombings were unsuccessful to forcefully end the war</li>
  <li>This was all done in secret to avoid attention from other countries, but the escalation of war caused protests in the USA</li>
  <li>National Guardsmen had killed 4 students from Kent University in one of the protests</li>
  <li>A peace treaty was signed in Paris in 1973, and prisoners of war were released on the condition that the USA withdrew and dismantled its bases</li>
  <li>There was a brief pause of fighting after America withdrew, but the fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam shortly after</li>
  <li>North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Reasons for USA withdrawal from the war</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Loss of support from the US people</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This was heavily influenced by the media, and when the media turned against the war, so did the people</li>
    <li>Deaths and casualties being shown on TV and people having personally lost loved ones turned people against the war</li>
    <li>Cronkite's news report, a popular media source turned against the violence in the war and promoted peaceful negotiation to end the war</li>
  </ul>
  <li>North Vietnamese had better tactics</li>
  <ul>
    <li>USA generally had a stronger military (they had better weapons, were better trained...)</li>
    <li>However, the surprise attacks from North Vietnam's guerilla warfare removed the USA's military advantage</li>
    <li>US soldiers had trouble finding and even identifying the enemy as enemy soldiers looked like South Vietnamese soldiers</li>
    <li>The traps and unexpected methods would catch US soldiers off guard</li>
  </ul>
  <li>North Vietnam retained the support of the Vietnamese people</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The local people resisted the American troops (eg. spreading the teachings of Ho Chi Minh, leading American troops into ambushes...)</li>
    <li>The Vietnamese people did not betray North Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
