<strong>Properties of metals</strong>
<p>Physical Properties</p>
<ul>
  <li>Metals are generally solids at room temperature (with exceptions of mercury, and at times gallium)</li>
  <li>They tend to have high melting and boiling points (because of the strong metallic bonds that keep the metal particles together)</li>
  <li>They are malleable (meaning that they can be pounded into a shape without cracks or breaks)</li>
  <li>This is because the particles are able to move after being pounded by a force without the whole structure breaking apart</li>
  <li>They are also ductile, meaning that their shapes can be changed without losing its strength</li>
  <li>Metals are also good conductors of heat and electricity</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Metallic Bonding</p>
<ul>
  <li>Metals are structured in a lattice, where regularly arranged positive ions are stacked with a freely flowing "sea of electrons" moving around the positive ions</li>
  <li>Because of the free flow of negative ions, electricity is conducted well in metals</li>
  <li>When a metal is pounded and changes shape, it does not completely break apart and is therefore malleable</li>
  <li>This is because even after the positive ions shift in position, they are still bound to the rest of the structure through the attraction with the free flowing electrons</li>
</ul>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<p>Alloys</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alloys are mixtures of metals and other elements</li>
  <li>This causes them to have different properties than the original metals (eg. better strength, toughness, resistance...)</li>
  <li>The atoms of alloys also are sized and arranged differently in a way that the layers cannot slide past each other as easily and makes them harder than the regular metal</li>
  <li>Therefore, alloys are often used instead of pure metals</li>
  <li>Some examples of alloys include...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Brass (a combination of copper and zinc, which is much stronger)</li>
    <li>Iron and Tungsten alloys are very hard and have very high temperature tolerance</li>
    <li>Iron and Chromium or Nickel alloys are more resistant to corrosion (damage)</li>
    <li>Mild steel (a combination of iron and a small amount of carbon) can be bought at a cheap price, used to construct. It is tough and can change shape easily</li>
    <li>Stainless steel (a combination of chromium, iron, nickel, and carbon) has a high resistance to corrosion and is also tough. It's uses are mainly known for cutlery</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<strong>Reactivity Series</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The reactivity series shows how reactive each metal is</li>
  <li>This is measured through reactions with water, acids, and oxygen</li>
  <li>The following table will show metal reactions with the most reactive metals at the top and the least reactive metals at the bottom of the table</li>
</ul>

<p>Reactivity series and forming a postive ion</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displacement reactions may occur when there are different metals present</li>
  <li>The metal with the higher reactivity will bond with elements that have been bonded with another metal and take them away from the less reactive metals</li>
  <li>For example, with the example CuO + Mg -> Cu +MgO, magnesium takes the O atom from the copper as magnesium has a higher reactivity than copper</li>
  <li>Another case is when an aqueous ion reacts with a metal where the same thing happens</li>
  <li>For example, in the equation Zn (s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) -> ZnSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + Cu(s), Zinc "takes" sulfate and forms aqueous zinc sulfate with a remainer of a copper atom</li>
</ul>

<strong>Extraction of metals from their ores</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Metals are extracted from ores through taking advantage of the reactivity series</li>
  <li>As metals are finite, they need to be recycled</li>
  <li>Carbon is used to extract metals</li>
  <li>To extract metals higher on the reactivity series than carbon, electrolysis is used</li>
  <li>When electrolysis is used, the process is often expensive due to the large amount of electricity needed</li>
  <li>To extract metals lower on the reactivity series than carbon, heating with carbon is used</li>
  <li>This works as carbon has a higher reactivity, and will isolate the metal through removing what it is bonded with</li>
  <li>This process is cheap because of the cost of carbon</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Extraction of Iron from Hematite (with the blast furnance)</p>
<ul>
  <li>A mixture of iron ore (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), coke (C), and limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) enter the blast furnance</li>
  <li>Coke is an impure carbon, and when a hot air blast is released within the furnance, carbon dioxide is released (C + O<sub>2</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
  <li>Next, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and coke (C) form carbon monoxide 2CO</li>
  <li>Afterwards, carbon monoxide gains oxygen from the iron ore to extract the iron (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3CO -> 2Fe + 3CO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
  <li>The iron accumulates and melts at the bottom of the furnance</li>
  <li>Limestone helps remove impurities in the iron ore (CaCO<sub>3</sub> -> CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>). The CaO produced later reacts with SiO<sub>2</sub> (an imurity) to form CaSiO<sub>3</sub>, which accumulates above the iron as slag (impure substance)</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Extraction of Aluminium</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aluminium is higher than carbon on the reactivity series, meaning that it is extracted through electrolysis</li>
  <li>Aluminium is extracted through the ore bauxite  which is purified to become aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
  <li>Aluminium is dissolved in molten cryollite to lower the melting point of the aluminium oxide, which means that the process is more cost-efficient and requires less oxygen. However, the cost of the process are still relatively high</li>
  <li>At the cathode, aluminium ions (Al<sup>3+</sup>) gain 3 electrons to form pure aluminium</li>
  <li>At the anode, oxygen ions (2O<sub>2-</sub>) lose 4 electrons to form O<sub>2</sub></li>
  <li>The carbon anodes may react with the oxygen gas released, causing the carbon anodes to corrode and making replacement of the anode necessary</li>
  <li>Therefore, aluminium is extracted through electrolysis as it is separated from the oxygen atoms</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Uses of Metals</strong>
<p>Uses of aluminium</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aluminium will naturally form a alumiium oxide layer by recating with nearby oxygen, allowing it to have a strong resistance tocorrosion</li>
  <li>A thin sheet of aluminium (aluminium foil) is used to contain food as the shape can be easily manipulated and the aluminium does not react to food</li>
  <li>Aluminium is also not very dense, meaning that it is relatively light. However, it is still strong, and is therefore used in different parts of aircraft</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Uses of mild steel and stainless steel</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stainless still does not rust and is resistant to corrosion as well. Also due to its strength, it is used in cutlery and chemical plants</li>
  <li>Mild steel is softer and more malleable, and is therefore used to make the different panels of a car and machine parts</li>
  <li>Zinc is used to make brass with copper, which forms an alloy used in locks, taps, door knobs, and instruments</li>
  <li>Zinc is also used to galvanise steel, which is a process to coat the steel with zinc and prevent rusting</li>
</ul>
