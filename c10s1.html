    </div>
    <div class="textarea"><div class="text" style="text-align:left;">
  <p>People were unhappy because of many reasons</p>
  <br></br>
  <strong>Peasantry</strong>
<ul>
  <li>An official count in 1897 showed that 77% of Russians were peasants</li>
  <li>They had been freed from serfdom (a system where a peasant was bound to the land they worked in) in 1861 in turn for paying redemption payments</li>
  <li>Peasants were left to try to survive by themselves and support their families</li>
  <li>Agricultural methods were outdated and inefficient, knowledge of modern methods was lacking</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Tsarism</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Russia had been ruled by the Romanov family</li>
  <li>The Tsar at the time was Tsar Nicholas II, who came in power in 1894</li>
  <li>Did not have the knowledge to rule well, and was not taught</li>
  <li>Saw himself as a supreme figure given the power to rule by God</li>
  <li>Did not want to give freedoms and democracy</li>
  <li>Recognised the need to modernise Russia on a level with the western powers</li>
  <li>Needed to control the growing middle class and the suffering peasantry</li>
  <li>People continued to worship the Tsar and respect him</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Nationalities & Languages</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Made up of more than 200 nationalities</li>
  <li>Majority were Slavs, and there were many minority groups</li>
  <li>The Tsar introduced Russification and forced all nationalities to speak Russian and adopt Russian culture while abandoning heir own</li>
  <li>This was enforced in schools, and local government</li>
  <li>This aimed to unite the people under one language and caused dissatisfaction</li>
  <li>Some people wanted to be away from Tsarist rule</li>
  <li>Russification forbade the many local languages spoken in Russia, even though this rule was ignored in rural areas</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Industry</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Severely behind other countries</li>
  <li>However, industry began to grow in the 1900s, shifting the previous focus on agriculture to industry</li>
  <li>The railway was created, allowing better transportation and increasing the need for raw materials and creating more jobs</li>
  <li>This was still not enough, and funds to invest in industry from sources such as foreign loans was needed, as well as the need for more workers in the city</li>
  <li>Therefore, it was necessary to move many peasants from the countryside to work in the cities</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Dominance over the Gulf</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The Iran-Iraq war could be seen as an attempt where Iraq tried to expand its oil reserves and shift the balance of power in the Gulf</li>
  <li>Iraq failed to do this, and did not make much shifts in power and also did not gain territory</li>
  <li>Iraq once again tried to take more power through the invasion of Kuwait, which would increase its oil supplies by a lot and provide access to the Gulf and a big harbour</li>
  <li>Iraq could also have enough power to take power from Saudi Arabia</li>
  <li>Saddam had ambitions to be the most powerful Arab Middle Eastern leaders</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Political Opposition</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Russia's government was an autocracy</li>
  <li>Localised revolts were easy to control</li>
  <li>Peasants generally could not write and read, which made organising revolts less likely</li>
  <li>Modernising Russia would mean peasants moving to the cities and more classes interacting with each other</li>
  <li>This caused a growing educated workforce aware of their rights, which increased the chances of organised revolts and demand for political change</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Events of the First Gulf War</strong>
<p>There were two main events of this war</p>
<br></br>
<p>Operation Desert Shield (7 Aug 1990-17 Jan 1991)</p>
<ul>
  <li>After Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait in August 1990, the fighting paused for five months, in which during this time, America, French, and Britain assembled forces in Saudi Arabia</li>
  <li>The United Nations demanded Iraq to leave Kuwait, imposing economic sanctions, and threatening to impose military sanctions if Iraq did not withdraw before the set deadline made by the UN</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Operation Desert Storm (17 Jan 1991 - 28 Feb 1991)</p>
<ul>
  <li>There were two phases of this operation: air war and ground war</li>
  <li>Air war (17 Jan - 23 Feb 1991): Airplanes and helicopters attacked Iraq in both Kuwait and in Iraq as well</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Iraq launched missiles on Israel and tried to cause them to invade Iraq (they failed), blew up oil wells in Kuwait, and poured millions of gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf</li>
    <li>Iraq invaded Khafji, Saudi Arabia for a small amount of time, but were forced out by the combined military of the west and iran</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Ground war (24-28 Feb 1991)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The forces assembled by the western powers and Iran attacked Iraq to force Saddam to withdraw his troops from Kuwait</li>
    <li>10,000 soldiers were killed when they were withdrawing from Kuwait by a bombing by the western and Iranian along a motorway connecting Kuwait City and Basra, Iraq, which was called the "Highway of Death"</li>
    <li>In the Battle of Medina Rige, Iraq lost 186 tanks and 127 armoured vehicles to the US army</li>
    <li>President Bush reported a ceasefire and the liberation of Kuwait from Iraq</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Consequences of the First Gulf War</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Saddam was heavily defeated and were pushed out of Kuwait in the first 100 hours of the ground war in Operation Desert Storm</li>
  <li>Most infrastructure had been destroyed by air strikes (eg. power stations, oil refineries, road, bridges, water purification plants)</li>
  <li>Saddam was not overthrown, and strengthened his rule by oppressing protestors such as  Shiites and Kurds</li>
  <li>There were 100,000 civilians killed or injured, and 20,000+ soldiers killed or injured in battle</li>
  <li>The quality of life fell, and people suffered from insufficient food, medical equipment, clean water, and facilities that improved welfare</li>
  <li>Economic sanctions imposed by the UN were not lifted, and Iraq could not export its oil, causing economic damage</li>
  <li>Some of America's forces stayed in Saudi Arabia to enforce the rule that Iraq could not fly certain aircrafts (to prevent Saddam from oppressing his people in the north and south of Iraq)</li>
  <li>The USA did not want to get rid of Saddam, but simply wanted to control his aggressive behaviour, as Saddam was still preferred over a potential Islamic revolution despite his brutal dictatorship</li>
  <li>Measures to activate future intervention in Iraq were put in place, which could not be removed unless Saddam removed all nonconventional weapons (weapons intended for mass damage: biological, chemical, and nuclear)</li>
  <li>Other countries no longer trusted Saddam after the invasion of Kuwait</li>
  <li>Stability was threatened in the Gulf during the 1990s, and nations in the Gulf were thinking whether removing Saddam or keeping Saddam as the Iraqi leader would help them achieve what they wanted</li>
</ul>
