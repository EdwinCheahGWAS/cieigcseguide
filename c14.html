<strong>Names of compounds</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Organic compounds are compounds that contain carbon (with the exception of metal carbonates, carbon monoxide, and metal carbonates)</li>
        <li>The prefix (first part of the name) tells you the amount of carbon atoms present in the compound</li>
        <li>The suffix (second part of the name) tells you the type of compound</li>
          <li>For example, a compound ending in...</li>
          <ul>
            <li>-ane and -ene is an alkene (a compound containing at least one bond of a pair of carbon molecules)</li>
            <li>-ol is an alcohol (a compound with at least one OH to hydrogen and carbon)</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Fuels</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Coal, natural gas, and petroleum and fossil fuels that are combusted to produce CO<sub>2</sub> and release heat energy</li>
        <li>The released heat energy can be transferred to use as electricity</li>
        <li>Natural gas is mainly componsed of methane</li>
        <li>Petroleum is a mixture of hydrocarbons</li>
        <li>Petroleum is less useful as a whole, but the different components of petroleum each have their own useful purpose called fractions</li>
        <li>Each section will be separate from the rest throuh fractional distillation</li>
        <li>Fractions of petroleum are thicker when there is a higher moleculer mass, which also gets darker alongside the thickness. When the molecules are longer, the melting point/boiling point becomes higher. When the size increases, it is harder to vaporise fractions as well</li>
        <li>Fractions of petroleum are used for...</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Used as bottled gas for heating and cooking (for refinery gas)</li>
          <li>Fuel (petrol) in cars (for gasoline)</li>
          <li>Raw material for making chemicals (for naphta)</li>
          <li>Powering diesel engines (diesel oil)</li>
          <li>Creating road surfaces (bitumen)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Homologous series</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The homologous series is a series of organic compounds sharing similar features and chemical properties</li>
        <li>Members of a homologous series will all have...</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The same general formula (structure of the chemical)</li>
          <li>The same functional group (group within the molecule with the same characteristic reactions)</li>
          <li>Similar chemical properties</li>
          <li>Small differences in physical properties</li>
          <li>The difference between each member of a homologous series is a CH<sub>2</sub></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Alkanes</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Alkanes are a homologous series of saturated (having no double or triple carbon bond) hydrocarbon compounds which contain only single covalent bonds</li>
        <li>Alkanes are generally unreactive unless they are burnt</li>
        <li>When alkanes are completely burnt/combusted, they form CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Alkenes</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Alkenes are a homologous series of unsaturated (having at least one double or triple carbon bond) hydrocarbon compounds which contain carbon covalent double bonds</li>
        <li>Fractional distillation of crude oil produces different useful fractions. However, some are still too long, and need to be broken down through catalytic cracking to be useful. This creates alkenes and hydrogen</li>
        <li>For example, kerosene and diesel oil are broken down to create petrol, other alkenes, and hydrogen</li>
        <li>Cracking occurs through vapourising the large hydrocarbon molecules with the help of a hot catalyst (such as silica or alumina) to break down the covalent bonds apart</li>
        <li>Therefore, smaller alkanes and alkenes are produced</li>
        <li>More alkenes tend to be formed at higher pressures and temperatures</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p>Distinguishing alkanes and alkenes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alkanes are saturated (do not have double or triple bonds) and alkanes are saturated (have at least one double or triple bond)</li>
        <li>Because of the double bond in alkenes, alkenes react differently than alkanes</li>
        <li>We can use bromine to distinguish alkenes and alkanes</li>
        <li>When alkanes are added to bromine water, there is no change</li>
        <li>When alkenes are added to bromine water, the bromine loses its colour</li>
        <li>This is because bromine atom react with carbon double bonds and are lost from the solution when reacting with alkenes</li>
        <li>This is called an addition reaction</li>
        <li>In addition to this, hydrogen atoms and steam also have addition reactions with double bonds</li>
        <li>Hydrogen addition reactions (hydrogenation) is often used for vegetables oils to produce margarine</li>
        <li>Steams also have addition reactions with steam (hydration) to form alcohol</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Alcohols</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Alcohols are a homologous series of organic compounds with the functional group OH (which influence the chemical properties of alochols)</li>
        <li>They burn/combust in oxygen, and produce CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
        <li>Ethanol is an extremely important alcohol which is found in alcohol drinks (eg. wine and beer)</li>
        <li>It is also used as a solvent and fuel for cars</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p>Manufacturing Ethanol</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethanol is manufactured by the reaction of ethene with steam or the fermentation of glucose</li>
        <li>Hydration of ethene: Ethene and steam react at a high temperature and catalyst to react into gas ethanol. It is later cooled down to become used liquid</li>
        <li>Fermentation of glucose: Yeast is added to a sugar/starch solution and left in a condition without oxygen at a temperature of 15-35°C. The yeast respires anaerobically to create ethanol</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Polymers</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Large molecules that consist of 50 or more smaller molecules (monomers)</li>
        <li>Each small molecules is bonded covalently with the others</li>
        <li>Different polymers have different smaller units (monomers) and bonds</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Synthetic Polymerrs</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Polymers are formed for many different uses</li>
        <li>For example, polyethene is formed through adding different monomer units and using them for plastic bags, bottles, and more</li>
        <li>After the <i>poly</i> prefix, the alkene in the polymer is stated (eg. poly<strong>ethene</strong>)</li>
        <li>Polymers are created through addition and condensation polymerisation</li>
        <li>Addition polymerisation is when several monomers with double carbon bonds bond together. One of the bonds of the carbon double bond break apart, and instead form bonds with the monomers around</li>
        <li>Condensation polymerisation is when a small molecule (often water) is removed and monomers bond. It is used to create polymers like nylon</li>
      </ul>
