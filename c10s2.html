  <strong>Cause of the 1905 Revolution</strong>
  <p>A revolution started in 1905 which was caused by a mix of long and short term reasons</p>
<br></br>
<p>Long Term Reasons</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dramatic Reform</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Had a 6% annual economic growth rate while Britain and France only had an annual economic growth rate of 2%</li>
    <li>Big changes to industrialise pressured the workers who had to work hard to obtain good results</li>
    <li>Russian workers had to work an average of 11 hours per day, with a 10 hour day on Saturday</li>
    <li>Factories had extremely bad and dangerous conditions and accidents often occurred with little concern for safety</li>
    <li>The creation of trade unions (a group of workers to protect their rights) was opposed by factory owners</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A working class and an emerging educated middle class were wanted to protect their rights and representation</li>
  <li>Peasants were discontent as their responsibilities increased with the growing population needing food, and still used poor farming methods</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Short Term Reasons</p>
<ul>
  <li>The humiliating loss in the Russo-Japanese war had demoralised the people as they were promised an easy victory, and were instead beat by a small Asian nation</li>
  <li>A liberal minister of the interior, Svyatopolk-Mirsky, was appointed, which encouraged those who wanted change to take action</li>
  <li>The loss of trust in the Tsar in the events of Bloody Sunday</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Events of Blood Sunday</strong>
<ul>
  <li>This event sparked the 1905 Revolution</li>
  <li>On 22 January 1905, priest Father Gapon led 200,000 people (including women and children) to ask for rights and the end of the Russo-Japanese war</li>
  <li>This was a peaceful petition that was not delivered violently</li>
  <li>Tsar was absent, so the police and troops took action</li>
  <li>Police and troops fired on the people without the Tsar telling them to do so</li>
  <li>There was no resistance, and this was a one-sided massacre</li>
  <li>Official estimated deaths were at 96, while opposition claimed that the death count could have reached around 4,000</li>
  </ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Consequencees of Bloody Sunday</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Trust in the Tsar</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The confidence once placed in the Tsar was shattered</li>
    <li>His reputation was severely damaged even though he did not order the shooting and was absent</li>
    <li>The belief that the Tsar had the people's interests prioritised was destroyed</li>
  </ul>
  <li>After people heard of the news...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Houses of nobles were attacked by peasants</li>
    <li>Protests were all across the country, 400,000 people were protesting by the end of Janugary</li>
    <li>Big universities shut down, with entire student bodies leaving the school to strike</li>
    <li>Middle-classes established the Union of Unions to demand for a  constituent assembly (representatives to create rules to govern a country)</li>
    <li>Railway workers went on strike in October, and the railway network stopped</li>
    <li>Lenin, Trotsky, and the revolutionary Menshevik party (which would later split into the "Mensheviks" and the "Bolsheviks") set up the St Petersburg Soviet</li>
    <li>Over following weeks, 50 more soviets (councils of workers) were formed across Russia, each demanding worker representation</li>
    <li>Sailors on the Potemkin battleship mutinied over serving rotten meat, and the firing squad joined the crew to throw the officers overboard</li>
    <li>The revolt of the sailors continued in other parts of the army and the navy</li>
    <li>Tsar began to lose control over the army in the middle of the Russo-Japanese war</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
