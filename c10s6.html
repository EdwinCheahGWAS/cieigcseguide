      <h1 class="subheading">The Rule of the Provisional Government</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="textarea"><div class="text" style="text-align:left;">
<ul>
  <li>Following the abdication of the Tsar, the Duma took over, setting up the Provisional Government to rule the country</li>
  <li>Provisional Government was originally led by Prince Lvov, and underwent some changes, which resulted into Kerensky leading a temporary group which aimed to govern until elections for a permanent new government at the end of 1917</li>
  <li>The elections never happened as the Bolsheviks took over with another revolution</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>The Provisional Government was able to achieve a few successes during its time. This included...</p>
<ul>
  <li>The disbandment of the Okhrana (secret police)</li>
  <li>Political and religious prisoners </li>
  <li>Freedom of speech and religion was granted</li>
  <li>Death penalty was abolished</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>However, the government had fallen due to a number of failures</p>
<br></br>
<strong>Russia's involvement in the war</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The Provisional Government wanted spoils of war and not to be associated with failure</li>
  <li>Launched the "Kerensky Offensive" which tried to push the Germans back and gain territory in the West which failed</li>
  <li>2 million soldiers had run away, some even killed their officers</li>
  <li>The main problems in Russia had been because of the war, and the decision of the Provisional Government caused these problems to continue</li>
  <li>568 factories closed and 100,000 jobs were lost in Petrograd from February to July</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Role of the Petrograd Soviet</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Provisional Government was not the only political body</li>
  <li>The Petrograd Soviet also helped rule Russia in the system of "dual power"</li>
  <li>The Petrograd Soviet was made up of workers, Mensheviks and socialists</li>
  <li>People listened to orders from two different groups, which sometimes contradicted</li>
  <li>The Soviet did not take power despite probably being more powerful, as it may not have been ready for a workers' revolution and may not have been able to run the country without the support of the army command and middle class</li>
  <li>However, its existence reduced the power of the Provisional Government</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Peasants and Land</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Peasants seized land after the March revolution</li>
  <li>Some soldiers forcefully took land from the nobility, with cases of murder and arson</li>
  <li>Provisional Government opposed the way land redistribution was being carried out, and wanted to do it legally</li>
  <li>However, the Provisional Government seemed like it was not recognising the fact that peasants needed land even though it did, just through legal methods</li>
  <li>The Provisional Government was also unable to stop this issue of violence</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Quality of Life</strong>
<ul>
  <li>People were unhappy because they lacked the basic requirements of living</li>
  <li>Food shortages, unemployment, and high prices continued to be big problems</li>
  <li>Grain seizures that took crops from the countryside for the army continued throughout the war</li>
  <li>Instead, government paid 100% more for the crops</li>
  <li>However, peasants were still unwilling to sell them, because there will little things left to buy, which were still highly priced</li>
</ul>
