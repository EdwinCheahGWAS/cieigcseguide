<strong>Invasion of Czechoslovakia</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Could not be justified on the grounds of self-determination as Czechoslovakia was made up of several nationalities and was not predominantly German</li>
<li>Czechoslovakia had industrial and agricultural resources that Hitler wanted to own</li>
<li>Hitler bullied President Hacha to give these resources to Germany</li>
<li>The German army seized the Prague, capital of Czechoslovakia in March 15, 1939les</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Agreements</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Pact of Steel (May 1939): A formal alliance of Germany Italy</li>
<li>Italy’s neutrality (Sep 1939): Italy was not ready for war when Britain and France declared war on Germany and opted for neutrality in the meantime after informing Hitler</li>
<li>British-French guarantee to Poland</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Poland was most likely to be the next target as…</li>
      <li>It was made by the Versailles Settlement</li>
      <li>Danzig was predominantly German</li>
        <li>The Polish Corridor separated East Prussia from the reset of Germany</li>
        <li>Poland had territories that had been German before the settlement (eg. West Prussia)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Hitler demanded the transfer of Danzig to Germany</li>
    <li>This transfer was justified under self-determination</li>
    <li>However, after Hitler’s actions in Czechoslovakia, he could not get away with his actions for Danzig</li>
    <li>Britain and France ensured Poland support in the case Poland was invaded</li>
    <li>Britain and France considered an eastern alliance against Germany, and tried to get the help of the USSR</li>
    <li>The help of the USSR was not given, and Britain and France ended up not being able to provide its immediate support in its guarantee to Poland</li>

<li>Nazi Soviet Pact (Aug 1939)</li>
<ul>
    <li>10 year non-aggression pact between Germany and the USSR</li>
    <li>Mentioned invading parts of Poland in private</li>
    <li>Did not seem to make sense due to rivaling ideologies: communism and fascism</li>
    <li>Germany’s purpose of signing the pact was to make sure the USSR did not attack Germany after it invaded Poland</li>
    <li>The USSR’s purpose of signing the pact was to stall for time in a lengthy war between Britain-France and Germany to build up defences and its military and to avoid war against Germany and Japan (considering its aggression) at the same time</li>
    <li>It was a win-win situation</li>
  </ul>
  <br></br>
<strong>Declaration of War (1 Sep 1939)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Claimed reason for war was because Germany refused to withdraw troops from seized territories in Poland
<li>The bigger picture of why war started was because Germany’s intentions to dominate Europe were now clear
<li>Opposition was necessary, or else it would seem that other nations accepted Germany’s dominance
<li>Understanding of Germany’s true intentions</li>
<ul>
    <li>Before the invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Germany had expanded its borders based on self-determination</li>
    <li>Invasion of the multicultural Czechoslovakia broke this impression and changed the understanding of Germany’s intentions as one to dominate Europe</li>
    <li>Even though the invasion of Poland was in line with self-determination, the new impression after March 1939 made it seem like a continuation of the intention to dominate Europe</li>
</ul>
<li>Hitler and the British-French guarantees to Poland
<ul>
  <li>Hitler was surprised by the declaration of war
    <li>He thought there was no point in doing so as Britain and France could do little after the Nazi-Soviet Pact</li>
    <li>Believed that declaration of war was even more unlikely as he believed that he could claim Poland without resistance like he did with the Sudetenland and other territories</li>
    <li>Therefore, war broke out on Hitler’s incorrect prediction (even though it would have happened around the time)</li>
