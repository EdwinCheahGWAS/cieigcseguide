<ul>
  <li>Peter Stolypin was appointed as the Tsar's closest advisor</li>
  <li>Stolypin was a key figure in modernising agriculture</li>
  <li>Believed that power should stick with the Tsar</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Politics</strong>
<ul>
  <li>After the grant of the October Manifesto (creating a Duma), the Tsar immediately issued the Fundamental Laws</li>
  <li>The Fundamental Laws gave Tsar his power back. Granting himself the power to dissolve the Duma and appoint ministers allowed him to keep his control over law</li>
  <li>The Tsar expelled the elected ministers he disagreed with, which caused the Duma to end up with representatives that agreed with the Tsar's decisions</li>
  <li>The First two Dumas were dissolved before they did much</li>
  <li>Therefore, the Tsar was able to regain his control over the law</li>
  <li>The Fundamental Laws removed representation</li>
  <li>However, the third and fourth Dumas brought important reforms such as increasing the number of primary schools to two times as much, and increasing spending on health services</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Agriculture</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Stolypin aimed to fix the problem of not enough food being produced</li>
  <li>Peasants relied on old methods on farming, which caused them to only grow enough food for themselves and little extra food for the rest of the people</li>
  <li>They depended on mirs, local communities that restricted peasants from buying new technology and decided what they grew</li>
  <li>A peasants land bank was made and more land was made available for peasants to buy</li>
  <li>Loans to buy land were provided to the peasants, encouraging them to farm privately</li>
  <li>Stolypin created a richer class of peasants called "kulaks" that left the mir and built their own farms</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Repression</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The Tsar compromised with the majority that were content with the October Manifesto</li>
  <li>The minorities that were not satisfied were brutally oppressed</li>
  <li>20,000 people were exiled from Russia</li>
  <li>1,000 people were hung by a noose which was known as "Stolypin's necktie"</li>
  <li>The Okhrana (Russian secret policy) became more involved, imprisoning and monitored people that were suspected to oppose the government</li>
</ul>
