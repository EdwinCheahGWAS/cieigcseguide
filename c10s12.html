      <p>In order to ensure that himself was in power, Stalin used several methods. These are some that you will need to learn for the IGCSE. This was used throughout his reign</p>
<br></br>
      <strong>Propaganda</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Stalin was represented as a central figure of Russia and he developed a cult</li>
  <li>Pictures, statues, and propaganda posters spread this image</li>
  <li>16 cities were named after Stalin in countries that were under Stalin's control</li>
  <li>Children were taught that Stalin was the "wisest man of the age"</li>
  <li>Photographs were changed so that he would appear to be the hero of the revolution alongside Lenin, and opposition such as Trotsky was removed from records</li>
  <li>Stalin's cult was further enforced after success in WW2</li>
  <li>There were big celebrations on Stalin's birthdays, and it was clear that Russia was dependent on Stalin</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Terror</strong>
<ul>
  <li>By 1941, Stalin almost had full control over all of Russia</li>
  <li>Stalin had sent people to the gulags (prisoner camps in Siberia) who had to perform harsh labour and lived in extremely bad conditions</li>
  <li>Around 50 million died in the gulags in 1930-1950</li>
  <li>Stalin was brutal towards his opponents and purged them if they posed a threat to him</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Political Action</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Political Rivals such as Trotsky and Kirov had been murdered</li>
  <li>Purges were carried out</li>
  <li>Anyone suspected to not be loyal were expelled, imprisoned, or put on public trial</li>
  <li>Stalin established himself as the only political figure with power</li>
  <li>81/103 of generals and admirals of the army were purged</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Control over Ordinary People</strong>
<ul>
  <li>20 million Russians were sent to the gulags, millions of those people died</li>
  <li>People lived in fear of the NKVD (Stalin's secret police) and the random persecution of the people</li>
  <li>Stalin introduced Russification, a policy to force people to only adopt Russian traditions and speak Russian</li>
  <li>Christians and Muslims were attacked</li>
  <li>Those who cooperated were given benefits such as jobs, holidays, housing, and education</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Control over Russian culture</strong>
<ul>
  <li>All types of media (eg. books, films, art, plays) were only allowed if they were in favour of Stalin's beliefs</li>
  <li>Stalin believed that the arts should picture his struggle for communism as a humble working man to justify harsh rule</li>
</ul>
