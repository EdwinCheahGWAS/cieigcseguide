<ul>
  <li>After America invaded Cuba, it was shown that the USA wanted to replace Castro with a governmnt that benefitted the USA more</li>
  <li>Castro's Cuba could not defend against America for much longer, unless it had the support of another communist country</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Here is the timeline of the events building up to the Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<ul>
  <li>Political Reasons</li>
  <ul>
    <li>People in the USSR wanted Khrushchev to be more aggressive against America</li>
    <li>Khruschev needed to prove that he was strong and could stand up to the USA</li>
    <li>Missiles were sent to protect a communist ally, Cuba, and act as a deterrent</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Military Reasons</li>
    <ul>
      <li>USA had recently put missiles in Turkey which was next to the USSR</li>
      <li>Placing missiles in Cuba, the closest base to America (only 90 miels away) would lessen the USA's military advantage</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Kennedy's Options</strong>
<ul>
  <li>After the presence of nuclear weapons in Cuba was confirmed, Kennedy had many options</li>
  <li>Here are the options that he could take on a range of how aggressive it was, with option 1 being the most defensive and option 6 being the most offensive</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<ol>
  <li>Taking no action</li>
  <li>Diplomatically negotiating with the USSR and Cuba to remove missiles</li>
  <li>Warning Castro to remove the missiles or bear consequences</li>
  <li>Using ships to cut off supplies to Cuba and prevent missiles from further entering Cuba (naval blockade)</li>
  <li>Destroying the Cuban military base through air strikes</li>
  <li>Invading Cuba with soldiers on ground to remove the missiles and maybe even Castro</li>
</ol>
<br></br>
<strong>The risk of nuclear war</strong>
<p>There were several events that followed which was extremely close to starting a nuclear war.</p>
<ul>
  <li>October 22: Kennedy publicly announced Cuba's possession of the missiles and put a ring of ships to "quarantine Cuba" by launching a naval blockade and preventing more missiles from entering. Kennedy also declared that if a missile was launched from Cuba, it would be viewed as an attack by the USSR</li>
  <li>October 23: Kennedy planned for the air force and 125,000 soldiers to attack Cuba</li>
    <li>October 25: Kennedy issued DEFCON 2, a readiness of combat forces to be launchedd in the following hours. This was the alert level right below nuclear war</li>
      <li>October 26: Khruschev wanted to prevent the nuclear war that seemed to be coming, and offered to remove the missiles if the USA did not invade Cuba</li>
      <li>October 27: A U2 spy plane was shot right over Cuba, and this was seen as a form of aggression, with many politicians urging Kennedy to launch the air strike. The world was on the brink of nuclear war</li>
      <li>October 28: Khruschev announced that he would remove the missiles and trusted that USA would not invade Cuba. The issue had been peacefully settled</li>
  </ul>
  <br></br>
  <p>War was avoided on the agreement for the Soviets to withdraw their missiles on the condition that the USA did not invade Cuba. A separate deal being secret for 25 years also agreed that USA removed their missiles from Turkey</p>
<br></br>
<strong>Aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Americans were proud as the leader of Russia had finally backed down for the first time in 20 years after Kennedy confronted Khruschev</li>
<li>Cuba was not yet a communist state before the crisis, even though Castro had declared himself to be Marxist. After the crisis, Cuba was heavily dependent on the USSR like the other Eastern-European communist states</li>
<li>The US military were not satisfied with just the removal of the missiles and thought Kennedy let Cuba and the USSR off too easy</li>
<li>Khruschev's withdrawal of missiles was slightly humiliating</li>
<li>However, US and USSR relations had improved as Khruschev backed down while trusting the US and also did not fail to guarantee that Cuba was not invaded</li>
  </ul>
