    </div>
    <div class="textarea"><div class="text" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Georges Clemenceau (Prime Minister of France)</strong>
<br></br>
<ul><li>Primary Aim: to secure France's frontiers, mainly by weakening Germany to an extent where it could not pose a threat</li>
<li>He was scared of future German attacks as...</li>
<ul>
    <li>Germany shared a border with France</li>
    <li>The border was not defined by a natural deterrence (eg. a body of water)</li>
    <li>German invasions of France had been frequent around that period (Franco-Prussian War, WW1)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<div>Therefore, in order to achieve his aims, he tried to achieve the following in the Treaty through a stern peace:

<ul>
<li>Permanent disarmament of most of Germany's army, air force, and navy</li>
<li>High level of reparations to be paid</li>
<li>Return of the previously French territory, Alsace-Lorraine</li>
<li>Transfer of great amount of German colonies to France</li>
<li>Independence of the Rhineland</li>
<li>Transfer of Saar Basin to France</li>
</ul>
</div>

<br></br>
<strong>Woodrow Wilson (President of USA)</strong>
<br></br>
<ul>America declared war on Germany only in April 1917, and did not recieve a lot of damage or casualties during the war
<li>The war was very profitable for America through trade and business opportunities</li>
<li>View of justice was not emotional, because of little losses of the USA, Woodrow Wilson did not feel like he had to harshly punish Germany for revenge</li>
<li>Aimed for a lasting world peace through his Fourteen Points</li>
<li>Wilson's Fourteen Points were based on ideals which contradicted British and French interests of expanding their colonies</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
To achieve his aims of a peace that allowed the maintenance of the prospect of war, he proposed to base the Treaty of Versailles through these "Fourteen Points" which served as solutions to prevent future war.
<ol>
<li>No more secret treaties</li>
<li>Free navigation of seas in peacetime and wartime</li>
<li>Removal of economic trade barriers</li>
<li>Reduction of armaments for all countries</li>
<li>Impartial settlement of colonial disputes taking into account the interests of both the colonial populations and the governing countries</li>
<li>German troops to leave Russia</li>
<li>Independence for Belgium</li>
<li>Return of Alsace Lorraine to France</li>
<li>Readjustment of Italian frontiers in line with nationality</li>
<li>Self-determination for peoples of Austria-Hungary</li>
<li>Evacuation and restoration of invaded Balkan countries</li>
<li>Self-determination for peoples in the Turkish Empire</li>
<li>Establishment of an independent Poland with access to the sea</li>
<li>Establishment of a general association of nations</li>
</ol>
<br></br>
Ultimately, some of these terms were accepted into the Treaty of Versailles
<br></br>
<strong>Lloyd George (Prime Minister of Britain)</strong>
<br></br>

Views in November/December 1918
<ul>
<li>Britain suffered from economic disruption, great casualties, and damaged infrastructure</li>
<li>Conerned about French frontier security, as a German invasion on France would threaten Britain as well because this would mean that the outer defence that France provided to Britain would be removed.</li>
<li>British wanted revenge and harsh punishment for Germany and to remove Germany's potential to cause war</li>
<li>Lloyd George recognised the necessity of these views to win election, and thus campaigned for Germany's harsh punishment and also to obtain Germany's colonies.</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
Views from January 1919

<ul>
<li>Lloyd George changed his outlook from November and December, and shifted towards a more moderate approach that did not punish germany as harshly.</li>
<li>Afraid that an extremely high reparations figure would slow Germany's economic recovery</li>
<li>Did not want to ruin German economy as it was one of Britain's essential trade customers, and would slow the economic revival of Europe</li>
<li>Against the independence of the Rhineland as this would cause Germany to have not enough money to consume British goods on a level similar to before the war</li>
<li>Against weakening Germany harshly, as a weakened Germany would become a poor border against Communism stemming from Russia</li>
<li>Lloyd George was scared that Germans would not be satisfied by the harshness of the treaty and seek revenge leading to overturning the Treaty and start war</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
Lloyd George's influence on Clemenceau
<ul>
<li>Convinced Clemenceau to abandon the idea of an independent Rhineland</li>
<li>Lowered the definite high amount of reparations proposed by Clemenceau</li>
<li>Abandoned idea of transfer of Saar Basin to France</li>
<li>Abandoned transfer of Danzig to Poland</li>
<li>Changes were made to prevent French domination and maintain balance of European power</li>
</ul>
