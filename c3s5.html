<strong>Remilitarisation of the Rhineland</strong>
<br></br>
<ul>
<li>The Treaty of Versailles marked Rhineland as a demilitarised zone</li>
<li>The 15 year Allied occupation on the west bank of the Rhineland was a humiliation to Germany as the Allies could technically invade at will (which was the case in 1923)</li>
<li>Allies left the west bank after only 10 years in the Rhineland, instead of 15 intended years</li>
<li>German troops marched in the Rhineland in March 1936</li>
<li>The 2 divisions Germany sent did not know the amount of opposition awaiting, which could be an opposition of up to 200 divisions</li>
<li>Hitler’s gamble that France and Britain were unwilling to start war over this issue was right on the money</li>
<li>Britain and France did not want to start war over Germany entering its own territory</li>
  <li>Hitler’s future campaign seemed to involve peace and 25 year non-aggression pacts</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Participation in the Spanish Civil War</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Francisco Franco and his Nationalists, started war against the Republicans</li>
<li>Hitler and Mussolini sided with Franco</li>
<li>Stalin assisted the Republicans</li>
<li>Nationalists were victorious</li>
<li>Hitler saw opportunities from this result</li>

<strong>Anti-Comintern Pact</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Signed by Japan and Germany in 1936</li>
<li>Italy joined in the pact in 1937</li>
<li>Aim was to oppose Comintern, the agency in the USSR that spread communism to other countries</li>
<li>True purpose was to guarantee that in the case one country was attacked, the others would not side with the USSR</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Anschluss</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Country with most German speaking people except for Germany was Austria</li>
<li>Treaty of Versailles prohibited Anschluss</li>
<li>In 1934, Mussolini had opposed Anschluss as Italy had viewed Austria as within Italy’s sphere of influence</li>
<li>From 1934 up until 1938, the diplomatic position of Germany and Italy had improved a lot and Hitler was also more recognised</li>
<li>In a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Schusnigg, Hitler bullied him into designate Seyss-Inquart, an Austrian Nazi as the new Minister of the Interior</li>
<li>Schuschnigg attempted to hold a plebiscite after realising that Hitler was aiming for the Anschluss</li>
<li>Hitler found out and forced Schushnigg to step down and made Seyss-Inquart the new Chancellor</li>
<li>After Hitler guaranteed Mussolini’s support, the German army marched into Austria and performed the union</li>
<li>Britain and France did nothing but merely protest
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Sudetenland and Munich Agreement</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The Sudetenland was disliked by Hitler as…</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It was made by the Versailles Settlement</li>
    <li>It had alliances with USSR and France</li>
    <li>It had a democratic government</li>
    </ul>
<li>Germans were complaining about discrimination by the Czech government</li>
<li>Hitler encouraged protests at first</li>
<li>Considered invading Czechoslovakia on May 1938</li>
<li>Did not want to as Germany wanted to avoid war with Czechoslovakia, the USSR, and France (with Britain at its side)</li>
<li>Diplomats came up with a plan to deal with Hitler before he would invade Czechoslovakia in the future (which was very likely)</li>
<li>Hitler met with Chamberlain to negotiate about the Sudetenland in two meetings. Here is the following information about the meetings</li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<ul>
  <li>Chamberlain was angered at Hitler’s change of intentions and told Britain (along with France) to prepare for war
  <li>Hitler wanted to avoid war, and decided to agree with Chamberlain’s decision to transfer mainly German Sudetenland areas to Germany
  <li>Munich Conference was held to resolve issue
      <ul>
        <li>Attended by Mussolini (of Italy), Hitler (of Germany), Chamberlain (of Britain), Deladier (of France)</li>
      <li>Decided that Sudetenland would be transferred over 10 days</li>
      <li>Decided that Plebiscites held for areas with uncertain dominant nationalities</li>
      <li>The agreement would guarantee the rest of Czechoslovakia after Hungary and Poland’s claims were addressed</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Czech government were forced to give away the territories, as it did not want to face Germany’s military force</li>
  <li>Hitler and Chamberlain decided on these terms known as the Munich Agreement</li>

<br></br>
<strong>Opinion on Appeasement</strong>
<p>Some saw it as weak and cowardly</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unfair on moral grounds, sacrificed Czechoslovakia which was left little choice</li>
<li>Hitler gained confidence</li>
<li>During the time Britain and France strengthen military, so did Germany</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Others find that this policy was acceptable at the time, despite not being successful</p>
<ul>
  <li>View on Hitler’s intentions</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Found Hitler’s demands to secure borders and defend itself reasonable</li>
<li>Opposition before March 1939 would have been seen as a war against self determination</li>
  </ul>
  <li>View on Hitler’s intentions</li>
  <ul>
    <li>As Japan and Italy were also recently aggressive, Britain and France were afraid of war against Germany, Japan, and Italy at the same time, and did not think they had great chances of winning</li>
<li>Britain could not threaten Germany without enough military power to fend off these countries and had to rely on methods such as appeasement</li>
</ul>
  <li>Democracy</li>
  <ul>
    <li>As Japan and Italy were also recently aggressive, Britain and France were afraid of war against Germany, Japan, and Italy at the same time, and did not think they had great chances of winning</li>
<li>Britain could not threaten Germany without enough military power to fend off these countries and had to rely on methods such as appeasement</li>
<ul>
  <li>The public wanted peace, and appeasement was popular</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the public was mainly against rearmament and war</li>
<li>The countries using appeasement were democracies, and could not ignore this popularity</li>
<li>Britain could not threaten Germany without enough military power to fend off these countries and had to rely on methods such as appeasement</li>
</ul>
<li>Communism</li>
<ul>
  <li>At the same time of Hitler’s actions to expand Germany, communism was spreading from USSR</li>
<li>Some politicians were more afraid of communism than the Nazis</li>
<li>Politicians wanted a strong anti-communist state to fight the spread of communism, which a Germany after appeasement could be</li>
