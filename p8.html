<p>The nuclear atom</p>
<ul>
  <li>The nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons</li>
  <li>Protons are particles with a charge of positive 1</li>
  <li>Neutrons and particles with a charge of negative 1</li>
  <li>Nucleons are the particles in the nucleus (meaning that they are the protons and neutrons in the atom)</li>
  <li>The symbol for the proton number is Z</li>
  <li>The symbol of a nucleon (protons or neutrons) number is A</li>
  <li>An isotope is an atom that has different amounts of neutrons from the regular number. Isotopes different in masses and physical properties, but not chemical ones</li>
  <li>Nuclide notation shows the mass number and atomic number of the isotope. The number on the top left will be the mass number, and the number on the bottom left of the symbol will be the atomic number</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Radioactivity</p>
<ul>
  <li>Radiation is where unstable atoms break down and release high energy particles</li>
  <li>The nature of radiation emission is random, which means that it is impossible to predict the exact behaviour of a nucleus in its emission of radiation</li>
  <li>When radiation passes close to an atom, it ionises the atom and causes electrons to move</li>
  <li>Alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays are the three main types of radiation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Alpha particles are particles of 2 protons and neutrons, which is a type of radiation normally found from nuclei that are too large</li>
    <li>It can be stopped by paper and has a little range in air. The ionsiation by the radiation is high</li>
    <li>Beta particles are particles that are electrons with a lot of energy. This type of radiation happens in the case where a nucleus has too many neutrons</li>
    <li>It can be stopped by thin aluminium and has a few tens of centimeters of range in air. The ionsiation by the radiation is medium</li>
    <li>Gamma rays are the emissions of electromagnetic waves of a large amount of energy. They are often found from nuclei that have an excess amount of energy</li>
    <li>The range of gamma waves in air is infinite and can be lowered by a thin sheet of lead. The ionisation by the radiation is low</li>
  </ul>
  <li>When a radioactive particle are close to other atoms, electrons will be pushed out and the atom will be ionised</li>
  <li>Alpha and beta (charged) particles can be deflected in electric fields and magnetic fields</li>
  <li>Alpha particles deflect towards the negative side, beta particles deflect towards the positive</li>
  <li>Beta is deflected more than alpha since it has less mass</li>
  <li>Gamma rays have no charge and don't deflect</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Ionising radiation</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ionising radiation can be used to describe the radioactive emissions of particles</li>
  <li>Alpha is the most ionising type of radiation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Alpha particles affect basically every atom around them</li>
    <li>They quickly lose energy and affect atoms only closely around them</li>
    <li>Therefore, because alpha particles only affect particles nearby, they can be harmless when controlled properly, but could be dangerous when alpha particles affect the body</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Beta particles have moderate levels of ionisation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Beta particles ionise less atoms than the alpha particles, and have a longer range</li>
    <li>Due to their ability to travel for long distances, beta particles could penetrate the skin and cause significant damage</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Gamma rays have the least ionising radiation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Gamma rays can a greater range and can penetrate easier, which makes it more dangerous when it is in great quantities</li>
    <li>Gamma rays are less ioning and affect less ions</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Applications of Radioactivity</p>
<ul>
  <li>Radioactivity can be used in several different ways</li>
  <li>Beta particles is to control thickness in the manufacture of thin materials (eg. paper)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When materials are on top of a source of beta radiation, particles can move through the material</li>
    <li>These particles are monitored by a detector</li>
    <li>The thicker the material, the more particles will be absorbed. This will also mean that less particles will pass through the material</li>
    <li>Depending on how many beta particles the detector receives, they send a signal to the manufacturing devices to increase or decrease the force on the material to make it thinner or thicker</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Some radioactive isotopes can monitor the flow of fluids. These isotopes are called tracers. Gamma radiation is used for this. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Tracers can be used to check blood flow and clots</li>
    <li>They can also monitor oil to check for any leakage</li>
    <li>Tracers are used in little amounts to make sure that people are not exposed to too much radiation as it is dangerous</li>
    <li>Isotopes that are used often last short times to complete the task of monitors, but not expose people to too much radiation</li>
    <li>Gamma radiation ionises less (and therefore will affect people less) and penetrates well (meaning that detection is easier)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Radioactivity can also be used in medical treatments (radiotherapy)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Radioactivity is used to treat cancer through killing living cells. This radiation is especially dangerous to bacteria and cancer cells</li>
    <li>Gamma rays penetrate the body to attack the cancerous cells</li>
    <li>The rays need to be moved around to prevent too much exposure and harm to healthy tissue</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Sterilisation is the use of radioactivity to kill bacteria and destroy viruses on medical instruments</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Gamma rays are extremely effective in killing bacteria as they can kill bacteria in the instruments thoroughly which hot water and chemical treatment would be less effective in</li>
    <li>This ensures that medical instruments would be safe for use</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Background radiation</p>
<ul>
  <li>Background radiation is the radiation around us in the environment</li>
  <ul>
    <li>50% comes from radon gas</li>
    <li>13% comes from medical uses (such as x-rays)</li>
    <li>11% comes from food</li>
    <li>10% comes from cosmic rays (high energy protons and atomic nuclei sourcing from the surface of the sun and other sources in the universe)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Background radiation is mostly natural, even though a small amount coming from sources such as medical applications are articifical</li>
  <li>The amount of background radiation can be different depending on the environment</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Radiation detectors</p>
<ul>
  <li>Radiation detectors detect the presence or chemical changes of particles that have been ionised by radiation</li>
  <li>Radiation iones atoms by knocking out their electrons</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Radioactive decay</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because of the instability of isotopes (which is often caused by the large size of the nucleus and the unbalanced numbers of neutrons and protons), isotopes will emit radiation and <strong>decay</strong> to become more stable and become smaller</li>
  <li>When isotopes decay and emit radiation, protons and neutrons are lost, meaning that the isotopes will change into a different element</li>
  <li>In nuclide notation, we can represent the loss of protons and neutrons</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Half-life</p>
<ul>
  <li>Isotopes will lose a number of neutrons and protons, meaning that the isotope will slowly become less active</li>
  <li>The half-life is the duration it takes for an isotope to reach half of their initial activity levels</li>
  <li>For example, a half-life will be complete when the activity falls from 1/2 to 1/4, and 1/4 to 1/8 of initial activity</li>
  <li>Half-lives vary in many isotopes</li>
  <li>Even though the activity of an isotopes will continue to halve, it will never reach 0</li>
  <li>With information, we can work out the half-life of an isotope by seeing the amount of time it takes for the activity of an isotopes to halve</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Safety precautions</p>
<ul>
  <li>As radiation is dangerous and can ionise atoms, they can also cause changes in living cells</li>
  <li>Therefore, to prevent the risks of radiation, certain measures and safety precautions are put in place</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Radiation sources are kept away from people to prevent exposure to radiation, and are kept in boxes coated with lead</li>
    <li>The amount of time and interaction with sources of radiation is reduced as much as possible to avoid exposure</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
