<ul>
<li>Early on, Truman seemed to have a unclear stance</li>
<li>He had dismissed Commerce Secretary for trying to persuade Truman to try to build international relations with the USSR</li>
<li>On the other hand, he had also removed a document arguing for tough opposition against the USSR</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>However, Truman's opinion was influenced later on by the insight brought by the two following messages</strong>
<br></br>
<strong>George Kenman's "long telegram"</strong>
<p>Geroge Kenman was an American diplomat based in Moscow who was an expert in the American foreign policy towards the USSR. He gave Truman the following insight</p>
<ul>
  <li>Russia was hostile, for the reason of being afraid that their people would learn about the freedom outside of Russia</li>
  <li>Communism did not create the mindset above, but did justify Russia's hostility towards other countries through the Marxist belief that problems could not be solved with only peace5</li>
  <li>Long-term partnerships offered to the USSR would be rejected and it would be pointless to try</li>
  <li>The way to deal with the USSR would be through containment (preventing further USSR expansion) </li>
<li>Said that the USSR would eventually collapse from internal struggles, and that the US should use containment and simply wait for the USSR to fall on its own</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Winston Churchill's "Iron Curtain" speech</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Argued for further US intervention</li>
  <li>Stated that an iron curtain had descended, in which a Soviet sphere had been established which was under Soviet control</li>
  <li>Stated that communists had risen in power by a lot to seek total control all around the world</li>
  <li>Stated that those in the Soviet Sphere did not have true democracy and the people were repressed, with the exception of Czechoslovakia</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The "Containment" Doctrine</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Greece had a civil war between communists and supporters of the monarchy since 1944</li>
  <li>Britain announced that it could not continue to support Greece against the communists in March 1947</li>
  <li>Turkey may have also been under threat</li>
  <li>Communist takeovers from groups backed by the USSR in France and Italy were a threat, due to the failure of their governments at the time, failing economy, and there was a bad harvest in 1946 and 1947</li>
  <li>USA had to act quickly to make sure that communism did not spread to Greece and possibly Turkey</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>In response, Truman introduced the policy of containment with these two features</p>
<br></br>
<p>1. Truman Doctrine</p>
<ul>
  <li>Truman got $400M from the Congress to help with Greece's military and economy</li>
  <li>Commitment to help those who suffered from aggression</li>
  <li>Described world to be separated by the free and oppressors</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>2. European Recovery Program (Marshall Aid), June 1947</p>
<ul>
  <li>Announced by George Marshall, Secretary of State, at Harvard University</li>
  <li>Stablise economies of Europoean countries</li>
<li>Prevent the further spread of communism in European democracies</li>
<li>16 countries accepted the plan, involving the western zones of Germany</li>
<li>Lasted 4 years</li>
<li>$13.3B dedicated to economic recovery in Europe</li>
<li>Loans were provided to foreign countries, and there were hopes for more earnings in US exports</li>
<li>Stalin did not allow countries under USSR influence to accept the plan</li>
  <li>Containment continued even after the 4 years of the Marshall aid and played an important role as part of the policies of the following American presidents</li>
</ul>
