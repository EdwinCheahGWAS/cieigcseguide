      <strong style="font-size: 2vw;">B10.1: Asexual and sexual reproduction</strong>
      <p>Asexual Reproduction</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asexual reproduction is a process resulting in the production of genetically identical offspring from one parent</li>
        <li>Bacteria divide themselves asexually by binary fission, which happens through the following steps</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Replicating and doubling the contents within the cell</li>
          <li>Diviing into two identical daughter cells</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Some plants reproduce asexually by the process of budding, which happens by the following steps</li>
        <ol>
          <li>A small part of the parent plant breaks off</li>
          <li>The new small part becomes a new individual plant and becomes independent and a clone of the parent</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Some disadvantages of asexual reproduction include...</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The population of the offspring do not vary much, meaning that a large amount of the population would perish under a change in conditions</li>
          <li>For example, a whole population would be likely to be affected by a disease</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Some advantages of asexual reproduction include...</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the right condition, population can increase rapidly</li>
          <li>Asexual reproduction is more efficient and faster</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p>Sexual Reproduction</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sexual Reproduction is a process involving the fusion of the nuclei of two gametes (sex cells) to form a zygote and the production of offspring that are genetically different from each other</li>
        <li>Gamete is a sex cell. They have a haploid nucleus, meaning that they carry half the chromosomes of other cells</li>
        <li>Cells normally have 46 chromosomes, while gametees have 23 chromosomes</li>
        <li>Haploid cells have one set of chromosomes (23 chromosomes), whie diploid cells have two copies (46 chromosomes)</li>
        <li>Gametes contain a copy of each chromosome, while other cells in the body have two copies</li>
        <li>Male and female gametes fuse to become a zygote, containing 46 chromosomes and 2 pairs of each chromosome (half from the father and half from the mother). This means that the nucleus of the zygote is diploid</li>
        <li>Some advantages of sexual reproduction include...</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The population will have more variation</li>
          <li>Species are therefore more likely to adapt because of the variation they have, allowing them to have a better chance of survival as a population</li>
          <li>This is because a certain genetic variation may fare better under different circumstances</li>
          <li>Disease may not affect the entire population because of variation</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Some disadvantages of sexual reproduction include...</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It is less efficient to find a partner, as there are two parents involved in sexual Reproduction</li>
          <li>Therefore, if a species cannot find a partner, they cannot reproduce</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <strong style="font-size: 2vw;">B10.2: Sexual reproduction in plants</strong>
      <p>Reproduction in the Flower</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flowers are the organs in plants that reproduce, often containing male and female parts</li>
        <li>The male part of a flower is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil</li>
        <li>Plants produce pollen, that produce the male gamete (sex cell)</li>
        <li>Pollen cannot move on its own, and instead reaches the female part of the plant through other factors like insects or wind</li>
        <li>Insects will move from plants to plants, with pollen grains stuck on their body. This means that when it travels, some of the pollen grains from one plant may be transferred to the female part o another</li>
        <li>The wind could also carry the pollen grains from the male part to a female part of a flower</li>
        <li>Fertilisation occurs when a pollen nucleus fuses with a nucleus in an ovule</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The pollen grain lands on a stigma of a flower of the same species</li>
          <li>The nucleus of the pollen grain goes down the pollen tube and grows to the ovary</li>
          <li>The ovary contains ovules that have the female sex cell (ovum). The ovum (female) nucleus fuses with the (male) pollen nucleus</li>
          <li>After the nuclei fuse, they form a zygote</li>
          <li>The zygote then divides and forms a seed in the ovule</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Seeds are inactive until the ideal conditions are meant</li>
        <li>They require water, oxygen, 68°F to 86°F to germinate</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p>Parts of the flower</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sepal: Protects the inside unopened parts of the flower</li>
        <li>Petals: Brifhgtly coloured to attract insects</li>
        <li>Anther: Produces the pollen grain, which is the male sex cell</li>
        <li>Filament: a thin cylindrical stalk that suppotrs the anther</li>
        <li>Stigma: The top of the female part of the flower that collects pollen grains</li>
        <li>Ovary: Produces female gametes/sex cells (ovum)</li>
        <li>Ovule: Carries female gametes/sex cells (ovum)</li>
      </ul>

<p>Types of Pollination</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are two types of pollination: Self-Pollination and Cross-Pollination</li>
  <li>Cross-pollination is the more popular way in which the pollen of one plant goes to another plant (this allows more variation in the population)</li>
  <li>Self-pollination is when the male and females sex cells are from the same plant, causing the offspring to be identical</li>
  <li>The lack of variation causes the offspring to not be able to adapt to new conditions as well as offspring with genetic variation</li>
  <li>However, cross-pollination has the disadvantage of relying on pollinators such as insects. If these pollinators are affected, then the plants dependent on them will be affected as well</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong style="font-size: 2vw;">B10.3: Sexual reproduction in humans</strong>
<li>Humans sexually reproduce</li>
<li>Fertilisation is defined the fusion of the nuclei from a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (egg cell/ovum)</li>
<li>The fertilised cell is called a zygote</li>
<li>The zygote forms an embryo (a ball of cells) which implant themselves into the wall of the uterus</li>
<br></br>
<p>The male reproductive system (Definitions from IGCSE Syllabus)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Testes: Produces male gametes (sperm)</li>
  <li>Scrotum: sac that holds the testes outside the body</li>
  <li>Sperm Ducts: Transfers sperm to the urethra</li>
  <li>Prostate Gland: secrete fluids for sperm to swim in forming semen</li>
  <li>Urethra: carries urine and semen out of the body</li>
  <li>Penis: transfers semen to vagina during sexual intercourse</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>The female reproductive system</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ovaries: Release female gametes (eggs)</li>
  <li>Oviducts: Transfers egg to uterus and the site of fertilisation</li>
  <li>Uterus: Where the fetus develops</li>
  <li>Cervix: Ring of muscle at the opening of the uterus</li>
  <li>Vagina: receives penis during sexual intercourse</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Male and female gametes (sex cells)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gametes are specialised for fertilisation and developing an embryo</li>
  <li>For this reason, the sperm and egg cells have different features</li>
  <li>Sperm cells have a tail called the flagellum which helps it move to the egg cell</li>
  <li>Sperm cells are very small in size</li>
  <li>Sperm cells have the ability of movement (locomotion)</li>
  <li>Around 100 million sperm cells are produced per day</li>
  <li>Sperm cells have extra mitochondria to supply energy, and has enzymes at its head to penetrate the egg cell</li>
  <li>The egg cell contains a cytoplasm with nutrients to allow embryo to develop</li>
  <li>The cell membrane changes after fertilisation to make sure that only one sperm enters</li>
  <li>The size of an egg cell is large</li>
  <li>Egg cells are shaped as round cells covered in a jelly membrane</li>
  <li>Thousands of immature eggs are in each ovary, and one is released per month</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Development of the Fetus</p>
<ul>
  <li>After fertilisation, the zygote develops into an embryo, which implants itself in the walls of the uterus and grows and develops</li>
  <li>The embryo receives nutrients that diffuse through the uterus lining</li>
  <li>This allows the embryo to develop its organs greatly during the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy</li>
  <li>When the organs have been developed, a placenta forms and the embryo is now a fetus</li>
  <li>The following time is for the general development and growth of the fetus</li>
  <li>The fetus is surrounded by the amniotic sac containing amniotic fluid, which protects a baby from bumps in the abdomen</li>
  <li>An umbilical cord connects the fetus to the placenta</li>
  <li>The placenta provides nutrients and filters waste products through a connection of the blood supply of the fetusand the mother</li>
  <ul>
    <li>These nutrients include gluocse, amino acids, fats, water, and oxygen</li>
    <li>Waste (eg. urea, CO<sub>2</sub>)is absorbed through diffusion by the mother's blood to make sure that the baby can stay safe</li>
    <li>The placenta has thin walls and a large surface area, allowing diffusion to be efficient. It also prevents dangerous molecules from entering the blood (but not all)</li>
    <li>The umbilical cord is cut after birth, which is painless because the umbilical cord does not have nerves that sense pain. It then falls off later</li>
    <li>The placenta detaches from the walls of the uterus and is pushed out</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Sexually Transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sexual intercourse without protection can transmit disease through the transmission of microorganisms through body fluids</li>
  <li>STIs are controlled through controlling the amount of sexual partners, the use of protection, tests, and educational campaigns</li>
  <li>An example of an sexually transmitted disease is HIV), which can also be transmitted through other exchanges of body fluids</li>
  <li>HIV infects a lympocyte (a type of white blood cell that fights against infection) in the immune system and multiplies</li>
  <li>However, HIV is not destroyed by lymphocytes as it is not recognised</li>
  <li>Therefore, the number of lymphocytes and amount of antibodies that can be made to fight infection are reduced</li>
  <li>This causes impaired ability of the body to fight infection, which leads to AIDS</li>
