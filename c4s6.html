<ul>
  <li>When a new currency was established, transport from the west to the east became blocked</li>
  <li>East Berlin controlled by the Soviets stopped supplying gas and electricity supplies to West Berlin to drive the western powers out</li>
  <li>The US' intelligence (CIA) contained reports of Truman knowing that Stalin was trying to remove the western powers from Berlin</li>
  <li>Response to this was difficult as...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If Truman allowed the blockade to continue and withdraw out of West Berlin, Truman Doctrine would appear to be an empty threat</li>
    <li>Challenging the blockade with military force could threaten peace</li>
  </ul>
  <li>US, Britain, and France decided to not back down and supply West Berlin through transporting resources through the air</li>
  <li>This was named Operation Vittles, and lasted for 11 months and involved 300,000 flights bringing 2M tonnes of goods</li>
  <li>The Soviets did not attack physically, but instead make it more difficult for pilots with ways such as temporarily blinding them with searchlights and intefering with communications</li>
  <li>Stalin ended blockade in May 1949 and failed to push the Western powers of Berlin</li>
  <li>65 German, British and Americans lost their lives in the operation</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Consequences of the Blockade</strong>
<ul>
  <li>US joined NATO in April 1949</li>
  <li>First time US joined a military alliance in a time of peace and that the US military could be involved even without a direct attack to the US</li>
  <li>11 other countries joined NATO in 1949</li>
  <li>Ernest Reuter, who was very anti-USSR, was elected for mayor in June 1947</li>
  <li>West German zones were officially merged in May 1949 as the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany)</li>
  <li>Konrad Adenauer, right wing Christian-democrat, became the first Chancellor in Aug 1949</li>
  <li>Adaneur was in control of domestic affairs, while the occupying powers were in control of foreign affairs until the creation of the creation of the West Germany Office in 1951</li>
  <li>West Berlin was not part of West Germany, but the US, Britain, and France continued to occupy it to protect it from the East</li>
  <li>Stalin's response was the formation of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)</li>
  <li>Key positions were taken by the Socialist Unity Party (forced combination of the Social Democratic Party and the German Communist Party)</li>
  <li>East Berlin became the capital of East Germany</li>
  <li>Did not form a military alliance like NATO, but instead increased control on satellite states, the countries that were formally independent but actually under Soviet control</li>
  <li>COMECON was established in January 1949 to control the economies of the Soviet countries</li>
  <li>USSR successfully tested nuclear weapon in August 1949</li>
  <li>Germany's position was set at one in which West Germany was vulnerable to Soviet aggression</li>
  <li>This position could be threatened by German rearmament and unification</li>
  <li>The European Coal and Steel Community was created in the Treaty of Paris and established a market between France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, and West Germany that imposed little or no duties (indirect import/export taxes) when internationally trading coal and steel</li>
  <li>This helped improve relations, and the US supported this</li>
  <li>French was against German rearmament, and the US Secretary of State: Dean Achaeson noted that disagreement over German rearmament could damage relations and the European Coal and Steel Community</li>
  <li>West Germany joined NATO in May 1955 with the circumstance that it did not have any biological, chemical, or atomic weapons and started rearmament</li>
  <li>In return, the USA and Britain kept forces in West Germany and formally ended its occupation in West Germany</li>
