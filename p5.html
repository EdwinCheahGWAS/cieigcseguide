      <strong>Phenomena of magnetism</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Magnets have a magnetic field around them with magnetic field lines that...</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Go from the north direction of magnets to the south</li>
          <li>Do not touch</li>
        </ul>
        <li>There are forces in between magnets</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Opposites forces attract each other</li>
          <li>Like forces repel each other</li>
          <li>Magnetic materials (not magnets) stick to either side of a magnet</li>
          <li>This is called induced magnetism, where magnetic objects become magnets and are attracted when next to permanent magnets (not repelled)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p>Magnetic Properties of soft iron and steel</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Soft Iron</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Iron that can easily be magnetised and demagnetised</li>
          <li>It is an induced magnet which becomes magnetised when it is near a magnet and placed in a magnetic field</li>
          <li>Soft iron fillings can quickly lose and gain magnetism when near a magnet</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Steel</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A permanent magnet that always has a force on other magnets, as it creates its permanent magnetic field</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Design of permanent magnets and electromagnets</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A permanent magnet is a material that is permanently magnetised and creates its own magnetic field</li>
        <li>Electromagnets are made from wire that allow an electric current to pass through to act as a magnet</li>
        <li>However, a permanent magnet does not need an electric current</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Electrical quantities</strong>
      <p>Electrical Charge</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are positive and negative electrical charges</li>
        <li>Positive and negative charges attract each other, while the positive-positive or negative-negative repel each other</li>
        <li>Insulators can be given a charge through friction</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Insulators can be rubbed against an object to gain or lose electrons</li>
          <li>When two objects are rubbed against each other, electrons can be transferred from a material to another, causing one object to be negatively charged, and the other to be positively charged</li>
          <li>An object becomes charged when electrons are added or removed from an object</li>
          <li>You could rub insulator rods against a cloth, and they will gain a charge</li>
          <li>You can try this on two objects and observe whether the charges are like or opposite by seeing if they repel or attract each other</li>
        </ul>
        <li>An electric field is a region where other charged objects are affected by an object with a charge</li>
        <li>Conductors are materials that can transmit electricity well, while insulators are materials that transmit electricity poorly</li>
        <li>Conductors often have a free flow of electrons, and include materials such as metals</li>
        <li>Insulators often do not contain free electrons, meaning that they are bad at conducting electricity. They include materials suchas plastic and rubber</li>
      </ul>
<br></br>
<p>Current, potential difference, and electromotive force</p>
<ul>
  <li>An electric current is a flow of charged particles in one direction</li>
  <li>The current is equal to the amount of charge that passes a point in a circuit per second</li>
  <li>Current is travelled by an ammeter</li>
  <li>Potential difference is the difference of the amount of electricity in two points in a circuit, and shows the amount of energy transferred from one point to another</li>
  <li>The electromotive force is the energy provided by each coloumb of charge that goes through the power supply</li>
  <li>Voltage is the unit of potential difference and electromotive force, which is equivalent to joule (energy) per coulomb (electric charge)</li>
  <li>Potential difference can be measured by a voltmeter connected to two points in the circuit</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Resistance</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resistance acts against a current and makes it lower</li>
  <li>The formula to work out resistance is voltage/current</li>
  <li>The longer wires are, the more resistance it will have, as there will be more collissions of electrons with the metal ions that conduct the electricity. </li>
  <li>When a wire is thicker, the electrons collide less as there is more space for the electrons</li>
  <li>The resistance and length is proportional, and when the length of a wire is increased by double, so will the resistance</li>
  <li>The resistance of a wire is also inversely proportional to the thickness of the wire (cross-sectional area), and when the cross-sectional area of the wire is doubled, the resistance of the wire will decrease by half</li>
</ul>
