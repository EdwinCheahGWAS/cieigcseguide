<strong>Collectivisation</strong>
<p>Collectivisation was the new policy for agriculture. In the Bolsheviks' point of view, private farming was not efficient. So how did collectivisation work?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seperate pieces of land were merged together to form collective farms</li>
  <li>Peasants were placed to work on the collective state farms </li>
  <li>They were told what to grow based on orders from the central committee</li>
  <li>Each household also had one acre of private land where they could grow what they wanted</li>
  <li>Workers did not have wage, but instead recieved a percentage of the farm's total profit by the end of the year</li>
  <li>However, few farms profited and when some didn't profit, the people got no pay</li>
  <li>Therefore, private land was very important to make profit, and it was estimated that 70% of meat in Russia came from these plots of private land</li>
</ul>
<br></br>

<p>The benefits of this were that </p>
<ul>
  <li>Bolsheviks could control production</li>
  <li>Kulaks, those in a wealthy peasant class created by Stolypin's reforms, stopped being created</li>
  <li>Peasants could work together</li>
  <li>This policy backed up communism beliefs</li>
  <li>This allowed the use of big machinery which would not be used in smaller farms</li>
  <li>The government could ensure that large amounts of grain were produced so that it could be exported to pay for technology imports and feed the population</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>The failures were that </p>
<ul>
  <li>Many rejected this dramatic change and did not want to give up their land</li>
  <li>There was no choice for the people, this change was forced by the army</li>
  <li>The kulaks were blamed for the poor production in the past</li>
  <li>A bad harvest and the fact that kulaks destroyed crops and killed animals caused a great famine</li>
  <li>People also did not like the fact that party officials controlled the farms. </li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The Five Year Plans</strong>
<p>The 5 year plans were 5 year plans with goals set for industrial production within each time frame</p>
<br></br>
<ul>
  <li>Gosplan, the central state planning commission, set goals for production of heavy industry</li>
  <li>These goals were passed on to regional administrators, to the who passed them the directors of the industrial enterprises (eg. factory owners)</li>
  <li>This allowed the government to control the amount of certain resources to produce</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Reasons for the introduction of the Five Year Plans</p>
<ul>
  <li>The NEP was a retreat from communism to survive the Civil War. This objective had been achieved. Stalin now wanted to more tightly control economy to develop the economy quickly</li>
  <li>Wanted a focus on heavy industry to defend against foreign threats</li>
  <li>Industrialisation was aimed to be a tool to create a Marxist worker's state, which the NEP did not do. Furthermore, the NEP was unpopular as it was not communist in principle</li>
  <li>Wanted to rapidly develop industry, and confront those who wanted a gradual approach and did not favour Stalin's policy of "Socialism in One Country"</li>
  <li>Stalin wanted rapid industrialisation to be an opportunity for Russia to become a developing superpower</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Changes of the Five Year Plans</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Five Year Plan</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The production of electricity tripled</li>
    <li>The production of coal and iron doubled</li>
    <li>Tractor works were being built</li>
    <li>There was a lack of skilled workers</li>
    <li>The production of consumer goods fell</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Second Five Year Plan</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Chemical industries grew</li>
    <li>Railways were built</li>
    <li>Russia was self-dependent in making machines by 1937</li>
    <li>Oil production did not reach the goal</li>
    <li>Consumer goods were ignored</li>
    <li>Ice cream production was severely lacking (oh no, little Johnny can't get that McFlurry today). </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Third Five Year Plan</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Heavy industry grew</li>
    <li>Focus now on weaponry and defence</li>
    <li>Steel and oil production fell</li>
    <li>Consumer goods ignored</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Success of the economic changes</strong>
<br></br>
<p>Industry</p>
<ul>
  <li>Between 1928 and 1940...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Coal output increased from 35M to 150M tons</li>
    <li>Steel output increased from 3M to 18M tons</li>
    <li>Oil output increased from 12M to 26M tons</li>
  </ul>
  <li>By 1940, Russia produced 20% of world manufacturing output</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<ul>
  <li>0.03 million tonnes of grain were exported for sale in 1928</li>
  <li>1.69 million tonnes were exported by 1933</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>General Successes</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.69 million tonnes were exported by 1933</li>
  <li>The plans also built industry in safer areas deep inside, which meant that German invasion would not take over key production</li>
  <li>It is also believed that the harsh conditions gave the people a stronger mentality which prepared the people for the losses in the war</li>
  <li>Russia had great developments (eg. education programmes in the collective farms, more urbanisation, better quality of life for some)</li>
  <li>New chemicals were used for farming and new machines for industry, which showed a development in technology</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Overall Failures</p>
<ul>
  <li>5 million died because of famine caused by collectivisation</li>
  <li>10 million were exiled and imprisoned for not complying</li>
  <li>An estimated 40 million died because of poor living conditions due to the plans</li>
  <li>Quality of products was lowered as quantity was prioritised</li>
  <li>Productivity was low, and labour was very tough on the workers</li>
</ul>
