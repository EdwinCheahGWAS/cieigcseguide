      <strong>Buildup to the 1917 Revolution</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Russia enters the war, supported by it's people</li>
  <li>People slowly lose support for war after heavy losses at the Battle of Tannenburg</li>
</ul>
<br></br>

<ul>
  <li>Tsar became the supreme commander on the Eastern Front</li>

  <li>High prices for food caused the poor to starve</li>
</ul>
<br></br>

</ul>
<br></br>
<p>1 March</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Tsar abdicates and the Provisional Government becomes the new government</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Reasons for the 1917 Revolution</strong>
<p>Historians argue that a few reasons may have caused the 1917 revolution. Some include...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tsar Nicholas' intolerance for political reform, and the lack of representation of the people</li>
  <li>Tsar Nicholas' military failures as commander showed the Tsar's poor decision making, which could no longer be completely blamed on ministers</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>However, two individuals have damaged the reputation of the Tsar greatly, causing great discontent among the people. These were Rasputin and the Tsarina</p>
<br></br>
<p>Rasputin</p>
<ul>
  <li>Originally a wandering peasant from Siberia that had joined a monastery</li>
  <li>Claimed he had special healing powers</li>
  <li>Tsar and Tsarina's son, Alexis, suffered from hemophilia</li>
  <li>Alexis was in a health crisis in 1908, and Rasputin was invited to the palace save him</li>
  <li>Rasputin managed to stop the bleeding and became close to the Tsar</li>
  <li>Had a terrible reputation and loved partying, having the reputation of being drunk and partying</li>
  <li>When Tsar became the commander, he had a greater role in leading the country</li>
  <li>He fired ministers and assigned posts based on his "visions"</li>
  <li>Was a close advisor to the Tsarina</li>
  <li>Damaged Tsar's reputation</li>
  <li>He was asassinated at the end of 1916</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Tsarina</p>
<ul>
  <li>She was disliked as it was clear that she did not want democracy and disliked the Russian people</li>
  <li>Became the ruler when the Tsar left to be the supreme commander</li>
  <li>She was German and put in charge of the country while the Russians were fighting Germany in the war</li>
  <li>Rasputin became her advisor and she dismissed and assigned posts rapidly under his influence</li>
  <li>Politicians were concerned that the Tsarina and Rasputin were German supporters trying to take over the government</li>
</ul>
