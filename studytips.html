      <strong>How to Study</strong>
      <br></br>
      <p>I think we all probably recognize the importance of studying, but how exactly can we study effectively? Well, first of all, to refresh your memory of what you have learnt in class, you should briefly revise the notes you've taken and identify the parts you are strong and weak in. After you have skimmed the notes, you should then focus on the weaker parts after you have reviewed the stronger ones, and add additional notes and information to strengthen your knowledge on a certain subject. Remember to fully understand the concept and review them afterwards as well. Please do not neglect the stronger parts, and remember to jog your memory once in a while to make sure you remember what you've learnt.</p>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Time Management</strong>
      <br></br>
      <p>Time Management is essential, and having medium-lengthed sessions to study with consistent regularly timed breaks is the key to success. The length of each session and breaks are geared towards an individual's ability to concentrate, but you should aim to improve and strike towards a range of 30-45 minute study sessions and short 5-10 minutes breathers in between. </p>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Taking Notes</strong>
      <br></br>
      <p>Taking notes is essential for studying, as it provides a record of concise information you need. This allows you to revise what you've learnt and effectively jog your memory in shorter amounts of time. When you're taking notes, highlight key dates and important information from the topic that is likely to come up in assessments. Organise them in a way where you can understand the notes and you could maybe add colour codes and annotations to emphasise certain areas in your texts. Also, taking notes is not only about words, but about the information expressed. This means that you don't have to only write words, but you can use other media such as diagrams, comics, etc. However, don't get too carried away as focusing on the content is the overall goal. </p>
      <br></br>
      <strong>Identifying your weaknesses and strengths</strong>
      <br></br>
      <p>Identifying what you're good at and bad at is very important, as you need to prioritise your study according to this information. This will allow you to balance out your knowledge in each subject so that you will score more consistently in your subjects. Now I will focus on how to identify your weaknesses and strengths. First of all, analyse how you are performing in class. Ask yourself some questions. Are you keeping up? How well do you understand what is said? After thinking about these things, order your subjects from weakest to strongest based on those questions. After having a list, try to prioritise learning in your worst subjects that you understand less and make sure that you have a good understanding of all the topics. After you have conquered your weakest subject, move up the list until you feel like you have a great understanding in all your subjects and will be able to reach the goals that you set for this year. </p>

      <strong>Study Schedule</strong>
      <br></br>
      <p>Having a study schedule is able to boost your productivity by limiting procrastination by managing your time carefully. Check out our study schedule template to increase your productivity and manage your time more efficiently. </p>
