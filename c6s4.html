<strong>Similarities</strong>
<ul>
  <li>On August 13 1961, Berlin found itself divided into two by the Berlin Wall separating the East and West Germany</li>
  <li>This surprised the people as the leader of East Germany had stated that there was no intention of setting up a wall less than 2 months before. Yet East Germany had set up a wall on Soviet orders</li>
  <li>The wall was made to prevent people from migrating from the East to the West. 2.6 million (around 15% of the population) had left East Germany for West Germany between 1949 to 1961</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Reasons why people left East Germany for West Germany</strong>
<ul>
  <li>After 1948, the difference in the quality of life between West Germany and East Germany continued to grow</li>
  <li>West Germany was rebuilt from the damage of WW2 under the economic support from USA's Marshall Aid</li>
  <li>East Germany suffered under harsh conditions and Sovviet communist rule</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>The impacts of migration before the Berlin Wall</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Social: Those who left East Berlin often were young educated scholars, which meant that the Communist Party feared losing its intelligent people in East Berlin</li>
  <li>Economic: Many skilled workers were leaving East Germany and by 1960, the percentage of people of working age was 61%. The initial percentage was 70% before the war</li>
  <li>Political: The leaving citizens made it appear that the communist rule was unpopular and led to the West using this as propaganda</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>To deal with these consequences, the government of East Berlin decided that a wall was the only way. Initially, the sides were separated with barbed wire, but on August 13th, the first wall was built</p>
<br></br>
<strong>Views of the wall in the East</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Thought that the wall was a good idea as it believed that citizens leaving their country for West Germany was favoring the side that was promoting militarism</li>
  <li>The East German government viewed the wall as a victory for peace as spy activity, trade-slavers, and other activity from West Berlin would end</li>
  <li>A brochure also stated that the East was losing its workforce because of underhanded tactics of the west</li>
  <li>It also said that the wall had prevented West Berlin starting war</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Reaction of the West</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The reaction was not strong as the western allies could still get what they wanted</li>
  <li>An invasion from East Germany was less likely and they could still deploy troops in West Berlin</li>
  <li>The West could use the war as propaganda claiming to be the side of freedom while the East used a wall to restrict the people's freedoms and keep them in</li>
</ul>
