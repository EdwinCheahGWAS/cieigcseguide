  <li>After WW2, USA saw communism as the biggest threat</li>
  <li>Communists in Russia planned to take over the world and spread communism, which contradicted the USA's political, economic, and ideological interests</li>
  <li>Castro's communists in Cuba threatened the market, power, and influence that Cuba had provided for the United States</li>
  <li>Korea and China fell to Communism, and there was a struggle in Vietnam as well</li>
  <li>Wanted to prevent the further spread of communism</li>
  <li>Because of this goal, the USA involved itself with several conflicts to prevent the spread of communism</li>
  <li>One of these conflicts was the Korean War</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Background Information of the Korean War</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Korea was controlled by Japan in the years 1910-1945</li>
  <li>In 1945, Japanese troops in the north of Korea surrendered to the USSR, and the south surrendered to the USA (during WW2)</li>
  <li>Korea was split into Soviet and American zones, the USSR occupying North Korea and the US occupying South Korea</li>
  <li>The line separating them was set at the 38th Parallel, an imaginary line 38 degrees north of the equator</li>
  <li>In 1947, the United Nations (UNO) ordered free and fair elections to elect a demoractic government to govern the whole of Korea</li>
<li>In 1948, the southern region held the elections under the superision of the UNO. The anti-communist Republic of Korea was set up under Syngman Rhee, with the capital and centre of government set at Seoul.</li>
  <li>The Soviets set up the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by Kim Il-Sung in the northern regions, setting the capital and centre of government at Pyongyang</li>
  <li>Both groups claimed to be the legal government of the whole of Korea</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>North Korean invasion of South Korea (1950)</strong>
<ul>
  <li>In 1950, Kim Il-Sung wanted to unite Korea under the leadership of the Communist Government</li>
  <li>By June 1950, he was convinced to launch the invasion to reach this aspiration</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Kim Il-Sung was supported by Stalin (leader of the USSR) and Mao Zedong (leader of China)</li>
    <li>North Korea's military was much stronger than South Korea's (in terms of armed forces, tanks, artillery, and air forces)</li>
    <li>Thought that the Americans wouldn't response as China was already Communist and Russia possessed an atomic bomb since August 1949, and also because statements from American  politicans made it seem like defending Korea was not a main priority of the USA. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Involvement of the UNO</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The UNO had been excluded in the setup of the communist government in North Korea</li>
  <li>However, when North Korean troops invaded South Korean territory, the Security Council immediately met to respond to the threat</li>
  <li>On 25 June 1950, the UNO passed the resolution to order the withdrawal of North Korean troops from South Korea</li>
  <li>This resolution was only made possible because the Soviet representative was absent (which was to protest against the USA's refusal to admit China into the UNO) as it could veto (vote against and cancel) the decision to act on Korea</li>
  <li>A second resolution on June 27 1950 was made after North Korea's intentions to not want to withdraw from South Korea were clear, requesting the memberss of the UNO to help South Korea repel the North Korea's military forces</li>
  <li>A third resolution on July 7 1950 organised troops from 16 countries (including the USA) to repel North Korea</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>USA's attitudes to the North Korean invasion of South Korea</strong>
<ul>
  <li>USA had been quite involved in the set up of the Republic of Korea (southern anti-communist government)</li>
  <li>The USA were did not want communism to spread further</li>
  <li>The USA considered the North Korean actions to be a part of the Soviet plan to take over the world</li>
  <li>If South Korea was successfully invaded, the USA was afraid that this would encourage China to invade Formosa (the old name for Taiwan), which was the base of the non-communist Republic of China</li>
  <li>If Formosa and South Korea were taken down, Japan (which was a major trading partner of the USA and important far Eastern ally against communism) could be threatened as well</li>
  <li>USA thought that in the scenario where Japan, Formosa, and South Korea fell under communist influence, the balance of power between communist and capitalist powers would collapse </li>
  <li>Therefore, the USA wanted to prevent this shift by repeling the invasion in Korea</li>
  <li>If the UNO failed, the USA would have most likely acted on its own</li>
  <li>The UNO initiative was mainly led by America</li>
  <ul>
    <li>General MacArthur commanded the armed forces</li>
    <li>Around Half of the ground forces were American</li>
    <li>More than 90% of the air forces were American</li>
    <li>85% of the naval forces was American</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Phases of the Korean War</strong>
<p>1) North Korean Success, June-September 1950</p>
<ul>
  <li>North Korean forces successfully invaded most of South Korea</li>
  <li>They captured the capital Seoul</li>
  <li>South Korean and UNO troops were cornered to the territory around Pusan (in the south-east of the peninsula)</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>2) UNO Success, September-October 1950</p>
<ul>
  <li>A counterattack was launched by the UNO and American marines</li>
<li>The UNO forces pushed through North Korean troops and continued northwards</li>
<li>MacArthur led the American marines through the sea 200 miles behind enemy lines to capture Inchon</li>
  <li>Seoul was freed from the North Korean forces, who retreated back to the original line at the 38th Parallel</li>
  <li>The original UNO mission had been achieved</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>3) Attempt to reunite Korea by UNO, October-November 1950</p>
<ul>
  <li>UNO forces continued to push northwards with the objective to unite Korea under an independent democratic government</li>
  <li>The mission went smoothly, North Korean resistance was weak</li>
  <li>On the 19th of October, the UNO seized the North Korean capital, Pyongyang</li>
  <li>A month later, American troops had attacked a long way up northwards to the Yalu river bordering China</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>4) Chinese attack, November 1950-January 1951</p>
<ul>
  <li>China was scared that the UNO forces would invade into China</li>
  <li>China counterattacked, and pushed the UNO forces all the way back to past the 38th Parallel</li>
<li>Seoul was captured again by the Chinese and North Korean forces in January 1951</li>
<li>In the middle of January, UNO lines kept their position at the 37th parallel (meaning that the UNO were pushed past the 38th Parallel)</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>5) UNO counterattack, January-July 1951</p>
<ul>
  <li>UNO pushed the North Koreans and Chinese forces back to the 38th Parallel</li>
  <li>Seoul fell back into the hands of the UNO in March</li>
    <li>General MacArthur proposed using nuclear weapons, and disobeyed orders, causing Truman to order him to be replaced by General Ridgway</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>6) Stalemate and an armistice July, 1951-1953</p>
<ul>
  <li>The two sides negotiated over two years at Panmunjom</li>
  <li>Fighting had continued with little significant changes</li>
  <li>However, losses were extremely great</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>UNO's results from the Korean War</strong>
<p>Successes</p>
<ul>
  <li>The UNO displayed its power by repelling attacks by the two superpowers: the USSR and China</li>
  <li>It took more effective action than the League ever had</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Failures</p>
<ul>
  <li>The UNO failed to unite Korea under an independent democratic government</li>
  <li>Harmful bad judgements were made (eg. MacArthur had claimed that China would not participate in the war just before the UNO would cross the 38th Parallel to try to unite Korea)</li>
  <li>There were many casualties and great damage to the land (4M Koreans died, and many were made homeless and fell into poverty)</li>
<li>UNO action would have failed if not for...</li>
<ul>
  <li>The Soviet absence in the meeting of the Security Council that decided to act on Korea</li>
  <li>The American decision to reject China into the UNO (as it had the power to veto the decision)</li>
  <li>The American troops in Japan since 1945</li>
</ul>
<li>To some, it seemed like the USA used the UNO to act on its own foreign policy</li>
<li>The Soviets complained that the UNO was just a capitalist tool to counter communism</li>
</ul>
