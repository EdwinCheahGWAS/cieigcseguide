<ul>
  <li>After the Bolsheviks came in power, opposition came from all sides, and a civil war broke out</li>
  <li>Lenin ordered a withdrawal from the First World War by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918</li>
  <li>The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk cost...</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 of the Russian population</li>
    <li>1/4 of industry</li>
    <li>9/10 of coal mines</li>
  </ul>
  <li>This was because continuation of participation in WW1 could undermine the efforts of the Bolsheviks to maintain power in the Russian Civil War</li>
  <li>The Bolshevik Red Army fought the White Army, a combination of supporters of the Tsar, military commanders that wanted to stay in the war, and foreign military from countries including the US, Britain, and France</li>
  <li>The cost of the war was big</li>
  <ul>
    <li>800,000 soldiers died while fighting</li>
    <li>8,000,000 citizens died from starvation and disease caused by the war</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The Bolsheviks won despite being heavily outnumbered</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<strong>Here were the reasons why...</strong>
<br></br>
<p>Strenghts of the Red</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trotsky's leadership</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Was a great organiser</li>
    <li>Had no military training, but was an extremely great commander</li>
    <li>He promoted men based on combat ability and was not biased based on class</li>
    <li>He was a great motivator, and visited the frontlines to motivate his men on his armored train</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Red Army</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Was supplied well</li>
    <li>Lack of experience was compensated by Trotsky's cooperation with ex-Tsarist officers</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Support</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Lenin ordered that food was given to the Red Army first, with the remainder of the food distributed to the cities</li>
    <li>This meant that people joined the army for food</li>
    <li>This also meant that the army was healthier</li>
  </ul>
  <li>War Communism</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This economic policy was one adopted to support the needs of the war</li>
    <li>Government took over industry and ran the factories</li>
    <li>Discipline was strict, and workers on strike were shot</li>
    <li>All surplus grain was seized</li>
    <li>People were discontent</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Peasants did not cooperate in producing grain as the surplus was seized</li>
      <li>Workers moved to the countryside for greater chances for food</li>
      <li>In 1918-1920, Petrograd lost 75% of its population and Moscow lost 50%</li>
      <li>Industry output levels in 1921 fell to 20% of output levels in 1913</li>
      <li>Famine would kill around 8 million</li>
    </ul>
      <li>Lenin ensured the people were under control, and the Cheka (new secret police) hunted down political opposition</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>Weaknesses of the Whites</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Whites were divided</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The White Army was a mixture of liberals, Tsarist officers, and foreign nations</li>
    <li>There was no appointed commander as each group believed in different things</li>
    <li>There was no unified leadership and the lack of cooperation weakened the Whites</li>
  </ul>
  <li>They failed to secure support from the people</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The Whites proposed return to the Tsar, which people were fearful of</li>
    <li>The Reds proposed peace, land, and bread</li>
    <li>Propaganda from the Red Army reinforced this fear</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The role of Foreign Nations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The Allies wanted to keep Russia in the war</li>
    <li>However, France and Britain eventually worried that participating in the Civil War would undermine their war effort and cost too much</li>
    <li>There were reports of atrocities committed by the White Army, which lowered its support</li>
    <li>The Allies withdraw from Russia after the end of WW1</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
